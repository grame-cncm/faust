# Inkscape2scad

This Inkscape extension is a modified version of Daniel C. Newman's [Inkscape to OpenSCAD
converter](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:250360) targeting finite element
analysis. It allows to turn a 2d path into a an OpenSCAD `polygon` and can
automatically add linear or rotate extrusion to it.

## Installation

Installation instructions are the same as the one described by Daniel Newman
on his web page: <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25036>

## Using

Instructions are the same as for the original version of this tool:
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25036>

Most of the differences come from the available parameters and they should all
be pretty self-explanatory.
