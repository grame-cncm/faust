<h1>faust2pd: Pd Patch Generator for Faust<a class="headerlink" href="#faust2pd-pd-patch-generator-for-faust" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>Version 2.4, April 08, 2011</p>
<p>Albert Graef &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:Dr&#46;Graef&#37;&#52;&#48;t-online&#46;de">Dr<span>&#46;</span>Graef<span>&#64;</span>t-online<span>&#46;</span>de</a>&gt;</p>
<p>This package contains software which makes it easier to use Faust DSPs with Pd
and the Pure programming language. The main component is the faust2pd script
which creates GUI wrappers for Faust DSPs. The package also includes a bunch
of examples. The software is distributed under the GPL; see the COPYING file
for details.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This faust2pd version is written in Pure and was ported from an
earlier version written in Pure&#8217;s predecessor Q. The version of the script
provided here should be 100% backward-compatible to those previous
versions, except for the following changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The (rarely used) -f (a.k.a. &#8211;fake-buttons) option was renamed to -b.</li>
<li>A new -f (a.k.a. &#8211;font-size) option was added to change the font size
of the GUI elements.</li>
<li>Most command line options can now also be specified using special
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[pd:...]</span></tt> tags in the Faust source.</li>
</ul>
<p class="last">Also note that you can now run the script on 64 bit systems (Q never worked
there).</p>
</div>
<p>As of version 2.1, the faust2pd script is now compiled to a native executable
before installation. This makes the program start up much faster, which is a
big advantage because most xml files don&#8217;t take long to be processed. You&#8217;ll
need Pure 0.21 or later to make this work.</p>
<p>For Windows users, there&#8217;s an MSI package of Faust available at the <a class="reference external" href="http://pure-lang.googlecode.com">Pure</a>
website, which also includes faust2pd.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Requirements</a><a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>faust2pd is known to work on Linux and Windows, and there shouldn&#8217;t be any
major roadblocks preventing it to work on other systems supported by Pure.</p>
<p>The faust2pd script is written in the <a class="reference external" href="http://pure-lang.googlecode.com">Pure</a> programming language and requires
Pure&#8217;s XML module, so you need to install these to make it work. Install the
latest pure*.tar.gz and pure-xml*.tar.gz packages and you should be set. (Pure
0.21 or later is required.) Also make sure that the LLVM base package is
installed, as described in the Pure INSTALL file, some LLVM utilities are
needed to make Pure&#8217;s batch compiler work.</p>
<p>To run the seqdemo example, you&#8217;ll also need the Pd Pure external
(pd-pure*.tar.gz), also available at the <a class="reference external" href="http://pure-lang.googlecode.com">Pure</a> website.</p>
<p>To compile the examples, you&#8217;ll need GNU C++ and make, <a class="reference external" href="http://puredata.info">Pd</a> and, of course,
<a class="reference external" href="http://faudiostream.sf.net">Faust</a>. Make sure you get a recent version of Faust; Faust releases &gt;0.9.8
include the puredata architecture necessary to create Pd externals from Faust
DSPs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Installation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Get the latest source from
<a class="reference external" href="http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/faust2pd-2.4.tar.gz">http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/faust2pd-2.4.tar.gz</a>.</p>
<p>Run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">install</span></tt> to compile and install the faust2pd program
on your system. You can set the installation prefix by running make as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span>
<span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">prefix=/some/path</span></tt>. Default installation prefix is /usr/local,
faust2pd is installed in the bin directory below that.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can also run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">install-pd</span></tt> to copy the supporting Pd
abstractions (faust-*.pd) to your lib/pd/extra directory, so that you can use
the patches generated by faust2pd without copying these abstractions to your
working directory. The Makefile tries to guess the prefix of your Pd
installation, if it guesses wrong, you can specify the prefix explicitly by
running make as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">install-pd</span> <span class="pre">pdprefix=/some/path</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The included faustxml.pure script provides access to Faust-generated dsp
descriptions in xml files to Pure scripts. This module is described in its own
<a class="reference internal" href="#appendix-faustxml">appendix</a> below. It may have uses beyond faust2pd, but isn&#8217;t normally
installed. If you want to use this module, you can just copy it to your Pure
library directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quickstart">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Quickstart</a><a class="headerlink" href="#quickstart" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">examples</span></tt> to compile the Faust examples included in this package
to corresponding Pd plugins. After that you should be able to run the patches
in the various subdirectories of the examples directory. Everything is set up
so that you can try the examples &#8220;in-place&#8221;, without installing anything
except the required software as noted in <a class="reference internal" href="#requirements">Requirements</a> above. You can also run
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">realclean</span></tt> before <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span></tt> to regenerate everything from scratch (this
requires faust2pd, so this will only work if you already installed the Pure
interpreter).</p>
<p>Faust Pd plugins work in much the same way as the well-known plugin~ object
(which interfaces to LADSPA plugins), except that each Faust DSP is compiled
to its own Pd external. Under Linux, the basic compilation process is as
follows (taking the freeverb module from the Faust distribution as an
example):</p>
<div class="highlight-sh"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># compile the Faust source to a C++ module using the &quot;puredata&quot; architecture</span>
faust -a puredata.cpp freeverb.dsp -o freeverb.cpp
<span class="c"># compile the C++ module to a Pd plugin</span>
g++ -shared -Dmydsp<span class="o">=</span>freeverb freeverb.cpp -o freeverb~.pd_linux
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>By these means, a Faust DSP named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xyz</span></tt> with n audio inputs and m audio
outputs becomes a Pd object <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xyz~</span></tt> with n+1 inlets and m+1 outlets. The
leftmost inlet/outlet pair is for control messages only. This allows you to
inspect and change the controls the unit provides, as detailed below. The
remaining inlets and outlets are the audio inputs and outputs of the unit,
respectively. For instance, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freeverb.dsp</span></tt> becomes the Pd object
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freeverb~</span></tt> which, in addition to the control inlet/outlet pair, has 2 audio
inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>When creating a Faust object it is also possible to specify, as optional
creation parameters, an extra unit name (this is explained in the following
section) and a sample rate. If no sample rate is specified explicitly, it
defaults to the sample rate at which Pd is executing. (Usually it is not
necessary or even desirable to override the default choice, but this might
occasionally be useful for debugging purposes.)</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the main ingredient of this package is a Pure script
named &#8220;faust2pd&#8221; which allows you to create Pd abstractions as &#8220;wrappers&#8221;
around Faust units. The wrappers generated by faust2pd can be used in Pd
patches just like any other Pd objects. They are much easier to operate than
the &#8220;naked&#8221; Faust plugins themselves, as they also provide &#8220;graph-on-parent&#8221;
GUI elements to inspect and change the control values.</p>
<p>The process to compile a plugin and build a wrapper patch is very similar to
what we&#8217;ve seen above. You only have to add the -xml option when invoking the
Faust compiler and run faust2pd on the resulting XML file:</p>
<div class="highlight-sh"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># compile the Faust source and generate the xml file</span>
faust -a puredata.cpp -xml freeverb.dsp -o freeverb.cpp
<span class="c"># compile the C++ module to a Pd plugin</span>
g++ -shared -Dmydsp<span class="o">=</span>freeverb freeverb.cpp -o freeverb~.pd_linux
<span class="c"># generate the Pd patch from the xml file</span>
faust2pd freeverb.dsp.xml
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Please see <a class="reference internal" href="#wrapping-dsps-with-faust2pd">Wrapping DSPs with faust2pd</a> below for further details.</p>
<p>Note that, just as with other Pd externals and abstractions, the compiled
.pd_linux modules and wrapper patches must be put somewhere where Pd can find
them. To these ends you can either move the files into the directory with the
patches that use the plugin, or you can put them into the lib/pd/extra
directory or some other directory on Pd&#8217;s library path for system-wide use.</p>
<p>Also, faust2pd-generated wrappers use a number of supporting abstractions (the
faust-*.pd files in the faust2pd sources), so you have to put these into the
directory of the main patch or install them under lib/pd/extra as well. (The
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">pd-install</span></tt> step does the latter, see <a class="reference internal" href="#installation">Installation</a> above.)</p>

<div class="section" id="control-interface">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Control Interface</a><a class="headerlink" href="#control-interface" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The control inlet of a Faust plugin understands messages in one of the
following forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bang</span></tt>, which reports all available controls of the unit on the control
outlet, in the form: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type</span> <span class="pre">name</span> <span class="pre">val</span> <span class="pre">init</span> <span class="pre">min</span> <span class="pre">max</span> <span class="pre">step</span></tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type</span></tt> is
the type of the control as specified in the Faust source (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">checkbox</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nentry</span></tt>, etc.), <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name</span></tt> its (fully qualified) name, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">val</span></tt> the current
value, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">init</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">min</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">step</span></tt> the initial value, minimum,
maximum and stepsize of the control, respectively.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span> <span class="pre">0.99</span></tt>, which sets the control <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt> to the value 0.99, and outputs
nothing.</li>
<li>Just <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt>, which outputs the (fully qualified) name and current value of
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt> control on the control outlet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Control names can be specified in their fully qualified form, like e.g.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/gnu/bar/foo</span></tt> which indicates the control <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt> in the subgroup <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bar</span></tt>
of the topmost group <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnu</span></tt>, following the hierarchical group layout defined
in the Faust source. This lets you distinguish between different controls with
the same name which are located in different groups. To find out about all the
controls of a unit and their fully qualified names, you can bang the control
inlet of the unit as described above, and connect its control outlet to a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print</span></tt> object, which will cause the descriptions of all controls to be
printed in Pd&#8217;s main window. (The same information can also be used, e.g., to
initialize GUI elements with the proper values. Patches generated with
faust2pd rely on this.)</p>
<p>You can also specify just a part of the control path (like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bar/foo</span></tt> or just
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt> in the example above) which means that the message applies to <em>all</em>
controls which have the given pathname as the final portion of their fully
qualified name. Thus, if there is more than one <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt> control in different
groups of the Faust unit then sending the message <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt> to the control inlet
will report the fully qualified name and value for each of them. Likewise,
sending <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span> <span class="pre">0.99</span></tt> will set the value of all controls named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt> at once.</p>
<p>Concerning the naming of Faust controls in Pd you should also note the
following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A unit name can be specified at object creation time, in which case the
given symbol is used as a prefix for all control names of the unit. E.g.,
the control <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/gnu/bar/foo</span></tt> of an object <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">baz~</span></tt> created with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">baz~</span>
<span class="pre">baz1</span></tt> has the fully qualified name <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/baz1/gnu/bar/foo</span></tt>. This lets you
distinguish different instances of an object such as, e.g., different voices
of a polyphonic synth unit.</li>
<li>Pd&#8217;s input syntax for symbols is rather restrictive. Therefore group and
control names in the Faust source are mangled into a form which only
contains alphanumeric characters and hyphens, so that the control names are
always legal Pd symbols. For instance, a Faust control name like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">meter</span> <span class="pre">#1</span>
<span class="pre">(dB)</span></tt> will become <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">meter-1-dB</span></tt> which can be input directly as a symbol in
Pd without any problems.</li>
<li>&#8220;Anonymous&#8221; groups and controls (groups and controls which have empty labels
in the Faust source) are omitted from the path specification. E.g., if
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt> is a control located in a main group with an empty name then the
fully qualified name of the control is just <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/foo</span></tt> rather than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//foo</span></tt>.
Likewise, an anonymous control in the group <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/foo/bar</span></tt> is named just
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/foo/bar</span></tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/foo/bar/</span></tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, there is also a special control named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active</span></tt> which is
generated automatically for your convenience. The default behaviour of this
control is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active</span></tt> is nonzero (the default), the unit works as usual.</li>
<li>When <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active</span></tt> is zero, and the unit&#8217;s number of audio inputs and outputs
match, then the audio input is simply passed through.</li>
<li>When <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active</span></tt> is zero, but the unit&#8217;s number of audio inputs and outputs
do <em>not</em> match, then the unit generates silence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active</span></tt> control frequently alleviates the need for special &#8220;bypass&#8221; or
&#8220;mute&#8221; controls in the Faust source. However, if the default behaviour of the
generated control is not appropriate you can also define your own custom
version of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active</span></tt> explicitly in the Faust program; in this case the custom
version will override the default one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Examples</a><a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In the examples subdirectory you&#8217;ll find a bunch of sample Faust DSPs and Pd
patches illustrating how Faust units are used in Pd.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The examples/basic/test.pd patch demonstrates the basics of operating &#8220;bare&#8221;
Faust plugins in Pd. You&#8217;ll rarely have to do this when using the wrappers
generated with the faust2pd program, but it is a useful starting point to
take a look behind the scenes anyway.</li>
<li>The examples/faust directory contains all the examples from (an earlier
version of) the Faust distribution, along with corresponding Pd wrappers
generated with faust2pd. Have a look at examples/faust/faustdemo.pd to see
some of the DSPs in action. Note that not all examples from the Faust
distribution are working out of the box because of name clashes with Pd
builtins, so we renamed those. We also edited some of the .dsp sources
(e.g., turning buttons into checkboxes or sliders into nentries) where this
seemed necessary to make it easier to operate the Pd patches.</li>
<li>The examples/synth directory contains various plugins and patches showing
how to implement polyphonic synthesizers using Faust units. Take a look at
examples/synth/synth.pd for an example. If you have properly configured your
interfaces then you should be able to play the synthesizer via Pd&#8217;s MIDI
input.</li>
<li>The examples/seqdemo/seqdemo.pd patch demonstrates how to operate a
multitimbral synth, built with Faust units, in an automatic fashion using a
pattern sequencer programmed in Pure. This example requires the Pure
interpreter as well as the pd-pure plugin available from
<a class="reference external" href="http://pure-lang.googlecode.com">http://pure-lang.googlecode.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wrapping-dsps-with-faust2pd">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Wrapping DSPs with faust2pd</a><a class="headerlink" href="#wrapping-dsps-with-faust2pd" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The faust2pd script generates Pd patches from the dsp.xml files created by
Faust when run with the -xml option. Most of the sample patches were actually
created that way. After installation you can run the script as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-pure"><div class="highlight"><pre>faust2pd [-hVbs] [-f size] [-o output-file] [-n #voices]
  [-r max] [-X patterns] [-x width] [-y height] input-file
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The default output filename is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">input-file</span></tt> with new extension
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pd</span></tt>. Thus, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">faust2pd</span> <span class="pre">filename.dsp.xml</span></tt> creates a Pd patch named
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">filename.pd</span></tt> from the Faust XML description in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">filename.dsp.xml</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The faust2pd program understands a number of options which affect the layout
of the GUI elements and the contents of the generated patch. Here is a brief
list of the available options:</p>
<table class="docutils option-list" frame="void" rules="none">

<p>Just like the Faust plugin itself, the generated patch has a control
input/output as the leftmost inlet/outlet pair, and the remaining plugs are
signal inlets and outlets for each audio input/output of the Faust
unit. However, the control inlet/outlet pair works slightly different from
that of the Faust plugin. Instead of being used for control replies, the
control outlet of the patch simply passes through its control input (after
processing messages which are understood by the wrapped plugin). By these
means control messages can flow along with the audio signal through an entire
chain of Faust units. (You can find an example of this in
examples/faust/faustdemo.pd.) Moreover, when generating a polyphonic synth
patch using the -n option then there will actually be two control inlets, one
for note messages and one for ordinary control messages; this is illustrated
in the examples/synth/synth.pd example.</p>
<p>The generated patch also includes the necessary GUI elements to see and change
all (active and passive) controls of the Faust unit. Faust control elements
are mapped to Pd GUI elements in an obvious fashion, following the horizontal
and vertical layout specified in the Faust source. The script also adds
special buttons for resetting all controls to their defaults and to operate
the special <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active</span></tt> control.</p>
<p>This generally works very well, but you should be aware that the control GUIs
generated by faust2pd are somewhat hampered by the limited range of GUI
elements available in a vanilla Pd installation. As a remedy, faust2pd
provides various options to change the content of the generated wrapper and
work around these limitations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There are no real button widgets as required by the Faust specification,
so bangs are used instead. There is a global delay time for switching the
control from 1 back to 0, which can be changed by sending a value in
milliseconds to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">faust-delay</span></tt> receiver. If you need interactive
control over the switching time then it is better to use checkboxes instead,
or you can have faust2pd automatically substitute checkboxes for all buttons
in a patch by invoking it with the -f a.k.a. &#8211;fake-buttons option.</li>
<li>Sliders in Pd do not display their value in numeric form so it may be hard
to figure out what the current value is. Therefore faust2pd has an option -s
a.k.a. &#8211;slider-nums which causes it to add a number box to each slider
control. (This flag also applies to Faust&#8217;s passive bargraph controls, as
these are implemented using sliders, see below.)</li>
<li>Pd&#8217;s sliders also have no provision for specifying a stepsize, so they are
an awkward way to input integral values from a small range. OTOH, Faust
doesn&#8217;t support the &#8220;radio&#8221; control elements which Pd provides for that
purpose. As a remedy, faust2pd allows you to specify the option -r max
(a.k.a. &#8211;radio-sliders=max) to indicate that sliders with integral values
from the range 0..max-1 are to be mapped to corresponding Pd radio controls.</li>
<li>Faust&#8217;s bargraphs are emulated using sliders. Note that these are passive
controls which just display a value computed by the Faust unit. A different
background color is used for these widgets so that you can distinguish them
from the ordinary (active) slider controls. The values shown in passive
controls are sampled every 40 ms by default. You can change this value by
sending an appropriate message to the global <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">faust-timer</span></tt> receiver.</li>
<li>Since Pd has no &#8220;tabbed&#8221; (notebook-like) GUI element, Faust&#8217;s tgroups are
mapped to hgroups instead. It may be difficult to present large and
complicated control interfaces without tabbed dialogs, though. As a remedy,
you can control the amount of horizontal or vertical space available for the
GUI area with the -x and -y (a.k.a. &#8211;width and &#8211;height) options and
faust2pd will then try to break rows and columns in the layout to make
everything fit within that area. (This feature has only been tested with
simple layouts so far, so beware.)</li>
<li>You can also exclude certain controls from appearing in the GUI using the -X
option. This option takes a comma-separated list of shell glob patterns
indicating either just the names or the fully qualified paths of Faust
controls which are to be excluded from the GUI. For instance, the option
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-X</span> <span class="pre">'volume,meter*,faust/resonator?/*'</span></tt> will exclude all volume controls,
all controls whose names start with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">meter</span></tt>, and all controls in groups
matching <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">faust/resonator?</span></tt>. (Note that the argument to -X has to be
quoted if it contains any wildcards such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt>, so that the
shell doesn&#8217;t try to expand the patterns beforehand. Also note that only one
-X option is recognized, so you have to specify all controls to be excluded
as a single option.)</li>
<li>Faust group labels are not shown at all, since I haven&#8217;t found an easy way
to draw some kind of labelled frame in Pd yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these limitations, faust2pd appears to work rather well, at least for
the kind of DSPs found in the Faust distribution. (Still, for more complicated
control surfaces and interfaces to be used on stage you&#8217;ll probably have to
edit the generated GUI layouts by hand.)</p>
<p>For convenience, all the content-related command line options mentioned above
can also be specified in the Faust source, as special tags in the label of the
toplevel group of the dsp. These take the form <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[pd:option]</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[pd:option=value]</span></tt> where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">option</span></tt> is any of the (long) options understood
by faust2pd. For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-pure"><div class="highlight"><pre>process = vgroup(<span class="s">&quot;mysynth [pd:nvoices=8] [pd:slider-nums]&quot;</span>, ...)<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Source options carrying arguments, like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nvoices</span></tt> in the above example, can
also be overridden with corresponding command line options.</p>

<p>Creating Faust plugins for use with Pd has never been easier before, so I hope
that you&#8217;ll soon have much joy trying your Faust programs in Pd. Add Pd-Pure
to this, and you can program all your specialized audio and control objects
using two modern-style functional languages which are much more fun than
C/C++. Of course there&#8217;s an initial learning curve to be mastered, but IMHO it
is well worth the effort. The bottomline is that Pd+Faust+Pure really makes an
excellent combo which provides you with a powerful, programmable interactive
environment for creating advanced computer music and multimedia applications
with ease.</p>

<p>The faustxml module is provided along with faust2pd to retrieve the
description of a Faust DSP from its XML file as a data structure which
is ready to be processed by Pure programs. It may also be useful in other
Pure applications which need to inspect description of Faust DSPs.</p>
<p>The main entry point is the <a class="reference internal" href="#faustxml::info" title="faustxml::info"><tt class="xref pure pure-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">info</span></tt></a> function which takes the name of a
Faust-generated XML file as argument and returns a tuple <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(name,</span> <span class="pre">descr,</span>
<span class="pre">version,</span> <span class="pre">in,</span> <span class="pre">out,</span> <span class="pre">controls)</span></tt> with the name, description, version, number
of inputs and outputs and the toplevel group with the descriptions of the
controls of the dsp. A couple of other convenience functions are provided
to deal with the control descriptions.</p>
