	* Makefile: various changes to the make install/uninstall goals

	- add missing rm command for installed link in <prefix>/bin

	- make sure that missing install directories are created; this is
	necessary to make 'make install' work with a staging directory
	
	- install faust2pd into <prefix>/share/q/apps, where application
	scripts should go as of Q 7.8, to keep the main library directory
	clean

	- install faust2pd README into <prefix>/share/q/etc

	- it's bad to have a hardcoded pddatadir, use a second prefix
	variable 'pdprefix' instead

	* faust2pd/faust2pd.q, faust2pd/faustxml.q: updated to Q 7.8

2006-10-05  Albert Graef  <ag@>

	+++ Release 1.0 +++

	* faust2pd/faust2pd.q, faust2pd/faust-timer.pd: Change the update
	logic of the passive controls to use a custom timer (metro)
	instead of bang~, so that we don't eat up too much cpu. The update
	cycle now defaults to 100 ms. This can be changed with the global
	faust-timer receiver.

	* faust/puredata.cpp: do proper crossfades for "active" control,
	to prevent clicking when "active" is turned on and off

	* faust2pd/faust2pd.q: fixed wrong version number, added comment
	to generated patches

2006-09-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* README: updated and completed documentation

	* Makefile: make /usr/local the default install prefix

	* faust/puredata.cpp, faust2pd/faust2pd.q: separate control inlet,
	fully qualified control names now have '/' in front, special
	"active" control

	* examples/*/Makefile: cosmetic changes
