 * Two functions are provided:
 *
 * \li void typeAnnotation(Tree term)      : annotates a signal term and its subterms with type information
 * \li Type getCertifiedSigType(Tree term) : returns the type of a previously annotated signal term
 *
 * TypeAnnotation must be called first to annotate a signal or a list of signals, before being able to
 * call getCertifiedType on any subterms. GetCertifiedType will produce an error if a term was not
 * previously annotated.
