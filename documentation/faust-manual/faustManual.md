# Introduction 

## What is Faust?

Faust (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming language for sound 
synthesis and audio processing with a strong focus on the design of 
synthesizers, musical instruments, audio effects, etc. Faust targets 
high-performance signal processing applications and audio plug-ins for 
a variety of platforms and standards. It is used on stage for concerts and 
artistic productions, in education and research, in open source projects as 
well as in commercial applications.

The core component of Faust is its compiler. It allows to "translate" any Faust 
digital signal processing (DSP) specification to a wide range of non-domain 
specific languages such as C++, C, JAVA, JavaScript, LLVM bit code, WebAssembly, 
etc. In this regard, Faust can be seen as an alternative to C++ but is much 
simpler and intuitive to learn. 

Thanks to a wrapping system called "architectures," codes generated by Faust 
can be easily compiled into a wide variety of objects ranging from 
[audio plug-ins](TODO-tutorial) to [standalone applications](TODO-tutorial) or 
[smartphone](TODO-tutorial) and [web apps](TODO-tutorial), etc. (check the 
[Quick Tour of the Faust Targets](#a-quick-tour-of-the-faust-targets) section
for an exhaustive list.

This manual gives an overview of the Faust programming language and of its 
features through various interactive examples.

## What is Faust Good For?

Faust's syntax allows to express any DSP algorithm as a block diagram. For 
example, `+` is considered as a valid function (and block) taking two arguments 
(signals) and returning one:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = +;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Blocks can be easily connected together using the `:` "connection" composition:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = + : *(0.5);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

In that case, we add two signals together and then scale the result of this 
operation.

Thus, **Faust is perfect to implement time-domain algorithms that can be easily 
represented as block diagrams** such as filters, waveguide physical models, 
virtual analog elements, etc.

**Faust is very concise**, for example, here's the implementation of a one pole 
filter/integrator equivalent to $y(n) = x(x) + a_{1}y(n-1)$ (where $a_{1}$ is 
the pole):

<!-- faust-run -->
```
a1 = 0.9;
process = +~*(a1);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

**Codes generated by Faust are extremely optimized** and usually more efficient 
that handwritten codes (at least for C and C++). The Faust compiler tries to 
optimize each element of an algorithm. For example, you shouldn't have to 
worry about using divides instead of multiplies as they get automatically 
replaced by multiplies by the compiler when possible, etc.

**Faust is very generic** and allows to write code that will run on dozens of 
platforms.

<!-- If we stick to this, we should also talk about the web capabilities: in
other words be a bit more specific here. -->

## What is Faust Not (So) Good For?

Despite all this, Faust does have some limitations. For instance, it doesn't 
allow for the efficient implementation of algorithms requiring multi-rates such 
as the FFT, convolution, etc. While there are tricks to go around this issue, 
we're fully aware that it is a big one and we're working as hard as possible on 
it.

Faust's conciseness can sometimes become a problem too, especially for complex 
algorithms with lots of recursive signals. It is usually crucial in Faust to 
have the "mental global picture" of the algorithm to be implemented which in 
some cases can be hard.

While the Faust compiler is relatively bug-free, it does have some limitations 
and might get stuck in some extreme cases that you will probably never 
encounter. If you do, [shoot us an e-mail](https://sourceforge.net/p/faudiostream/mailman/)!

From here, you can jump to ... if you wanna get your hands dirty, etc. TODO.

## Design Principles

Since the beginning of its development in 2002, Faust has been guided by
various design principles:

* Faust is a *specification language*. It aims at providing an adequate 
notation to describe *signal processors* from a mathematical point of view. 
Faust is, as much as possible, free from implementation details. 
* Faust programs are fully compiled (i.e., not interpreted). The compiler 
translates Faust programs into equivalent programs in other languages (e.g., 
JAVA, JavaScript, LLVM bit code, WebAssembly, etc.) taking care of generating 
the most efficient code. The result can generally compete with, and sometimes 
even outperform, C++ code written by seasoned programmers. 
* The generated code works at the sample level. It is therefore suited to 
implement low-level DSP functions like recursive filters. Moreover the code can 
be easily embedded. It is self-contained and doesn't depend of any DSP library 
or runtime system. It has a very deterministic behavior and a constant memory 
footprint. 
* The semantic of Faust is simple and well defined. This is not just of 
academic interest. It allows the Faust compiler to be *semantically driven*. 
Instead of compiling a program literally, it compiles the mathematical function 
it denotes. This feature is useful for example to promote components reuse 
while preserving optimal performance.  
* Faust is a textual language but nevertheless block-diagram oriented. It 
actually combines two approaches: *functional programming* and *algebraic 
block-diagrams*. The key idea is to view block-diagram construction as function 
composition. For that purpose, Faust relies on a *block-diagram algebra* of 
five composition operations: `: , ~ <: :>` (see the section on 
[Diagram Composition Operations](#diagram-composition-operations) for more
details).
* Thanks to the concept of *architecture*, Faust programs can be easily 
deployed on a large variety of audio platforms and plugin formats without any 
change to the Faust code.

## Signal Processor Semantic

A Faust program describes a *signal processor*. The role of a *signal processor* 
is to transforms a (possibly empty) group of *input signals* in order to 
produce a (possibly empty) group of *output signals*. Most audio equipments can 
be modeled as *signal processors*. They have audio inputs, audio outputs as 
well as control signals interfaced with sliders, knobs, vu-meters, etc. 

More precisely :

* A *signal* $s$ is a discrete function of time 
$s:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. The value of a signal $s$ at time $t$ is 
written $s(t)$. The values of signals are usually needed starting from time $0$. 
But to take into account *delay operations*, negative times are possible and 
are always mapped to zeros. Therefore for any Faust signal $s$ we have 
$\forall t<0, s(t)=0$. In operational terms this corresponds to assuming that 
all delay lines are signals initialized with $0$s. 
* Faust considers two type of signals: *integer signals* 
($s:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$) and *floating point signals* 
($s:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}$). Exchanges with the outside world are, by 
convention, made using floating point signals. The full range is represented by 
sample values between $-1.0$ and $+1.0$.
* The set of all possible  signals is $\mathbb{S}=\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$.
* A group of $n$ signals (a *n*-tuple of signals) is written 
$(s_{1},\ldots,s_{n})\in \mathbb{S}^{n}$. The *empty tuple*, single element of 
$\mathbb{S}^{0}$ is notated $()$.
* A *signal processors* $p$, is a function from *n*-tuples of signals to 
*m*-tuples of signals $p:\mathbb{S}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{m}$. The set 
$\mathbb{P}=\bigcup_{n,m}\mathbb{S}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{m}$ is the
set of all possible signal processors.

As an example, let's express the semantic of the Faust primitive `+`. Like any 
Faust expression, it is a signal processor. Its signature is
$\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}$. It takes two input signals $X_0$ and 
$X_1$ and produces an output signal $Y$ such that $Y(t) = X_0(t)+X_1(t)$. 

Numbers are signal processors too. For example the number $3$ has signature  $\mathbb{S}^{0}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}$. It takes no input signals and produce an 
output signal $Y$ such that $Y(t) = 3$. 

# Quick Start

TODO Will be all based on the online editor... May be could be a simple copy and
paste of the session 1 of the Kadenze course...

# Overview of the Faust Universe

While in its most *primitive* form, Faust is distributed as a command-line 
compiler, a wide range of tools have been developed around it in the course of 
the past few years. Their variety and their function might be hard to grab at 
first. This sort chapter provides an overview of their role and will hopefully 
help you decide which one is better suited for your personal use. 

<!-- TODO: it'd be nice to have some kind of figure here summarizing everything -->

TODO: here say a few words about the philosophy behind the disto: the online
editor is the way to go for most users, then various pre-compiled packages
of the compiler can be found, then source, then git. Finally other external
tools for development.   

## The Faust Distribution

The Faust distribution hosts the source of the Faust compiler (both in its 
command line and library version), the source of the Faust *architectures*
(targets), the various Faust compilation scripts, a wide range of 
Faust-related-tools, the [Faust DSP Libraries](TODO) (which in practice
are hosted a separate Git submodule), etc.

The latest stable release of the Faust distribution can be found here:
<https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/releases>. It is recommended for most
Faust users willing to compile the Faust compiler and `libfaust` from scratch.

To have the latest stable development version, you can use the `master`
branch of the Faust git repository which is hosted on GitHub: 
<https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/master>.

For something even more bleeding edge (to be used at your own risks), you might
use the `master-dev` branch of the Faust git repository: 
<https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/master-dev>. `master-dev` is the 
development sub-branch of `master`. It is used by Faust developers to commit 
their changes and can be considered as "the main development branch." The goal 
is to make sure that `master` is always functional. Merges between `master-dev` 
and `master` are carried out multiple times a week by the GRAME team.

> Also, note that pre-compiled packages of the Faust compiler and of `libfaust`
for various platforms can be found on the [Download Page](__FAUST_DOMAIN__/download)
of the Faust website.

The Faust distribution is organized as follows:

```
architecture/          : the source of the architecture files
benchmark/             : tools to measure the efficiency of the generated code

# Compiling and Installing Faust

This chapter describes how to get and compile the Faust compiler as well as
other tools related to Faust (e.g., [`libfaust`](#libfaust), `libosc`, 
`libhttpd`, etc.). 

## Getting the Source Code

An overview of the various places where the Faust source can be downloaded is
given [here](#the-faust-distribution). 

If you downloaded the latest Faust release, just un-compressed the archive 
file and open it in a terminal. For instance, something like (this might vary 
depending on the version of Faust you downloaded):

```
tar xzf faust-2.5.31.tar.gz
cd faust-2.5.31
``` 

If you wish to get the Faust source directly from the git repository, just
run:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust.git
cd faust
```

in a terminal. Note that the `--recursive` option is necessary here since some 
elements (e.g., the Faust DSP libraries) are placed in other repositories.

Finally, if you wish to use the development (and potentially unstable) branch, 
just run:

```
git checkout master-dev
```

after the previous 2 commands.

TODO: see with Dominique for whatever comes next here...

Since release 2.5.18, Faust compilation and installation is based on `cmake`.


# Faust Syntax

<!-- TODO we should make a new introductory figure here and add some comments
about it. It'd be nice to make it interactive so that when people click on it,
they are brought to the right section. -->

## Faust Program

A Faust program is essentially a list of *statements*. These statements can be 
[*metadata declarations*](#metadata-declarations), [*imports*](#imports), 
[*definitions*](#definitions), and [*documentation tags*](#documentation-tags), 
with optional C++ style (`//...` and `/*...*/`) comments.

Here is a short Faust program that implements of a simple noise generator 
(called from the `noises.lib` Faust library). It exhibits various kind of 
statements : two [*metadata declarations*](#metadata-declarations), an 
[*imports*](#imports), a *comment*, and a [*definition*](#definitions). We will 
study later how [*documentation statements*](#documentation-tags) work:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
declare name  "Noise";
declare copyright "(c)GRAME 2018";

import("stdfaust.lib");

// noise level controlled by a slider
process = no.noise * hslider("gain",0,0,1, 0.1);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

The keyword `process` is the equivalent of `main` in C/C++. Any Faust program, 
to be valid, must at least define `process`.

## Statements

The *statements* of a Faust program are of four kinds: 

* *metadata declarations*, 
* *file imports*, 
* *definitions*,
* *documentation*. 

All statements but *documentation* end with a semicolon `;`. 

### Metadata Declarations

All metadata declaration in Faust start with `declare`. 

When used in the context of Faust program (e.g., `.dsp` file), they are 
followed by a key and a string. For example:

```
declare name "Noise";
```

allows us to specify the name of a Faust program in its whole. 

When used in the context of a library (e.g., `.lib` file), metadata 
declarations can either be "global" (as in the previous example), or associated
to a specific function. In that case, `declare` will be followed by the name 
of the function, a key, and a string. For example:

```
declare add author "John Doe"
add = +;
```

This is very useful when a library has several contributors and that functions
potentially have different license terms. 

Unlike regular comments, metadata declarations will appear in the C++ code 
generated by the Faust compiler. A good practice is to start a Faust program 
with some standard declarations:

```
declare name "MyProgram";
declare author "MySelf";
declare copyright "MyCompany";
declare version "1.00";
declare license "BSD"; 
```

### Imports

File imports allow us to import definitions from other source files.  

For example `import("maths.lib");` imports the definitions of the 
[`maths.lib`](TODO) library.

The most common file to be imported is the `stdfaust.lib` library which gives
access to all the standard Faust libraries from a single point:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = os.osc(440); // the "hello world" of computer music
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

### Documentation Tags

Documentation statements are optional and typically used to control the 
generation of the mathematical documentation of a Faust program. This 
documentation system is detailed in the 
[Mathematical Documentation](#mathematical-documentation) chapter. In this 
section we essentially describe the documentation statements syntax.

A documentation statement starts with an opening `<mdoc>` tag and ends with a 
closing `</mdoc>` tag. Free text content, typically in Latex format, can be 
placed in between these two tags. <!-- Why not markdown? -->

<img src="img/documentation.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

Moreover, optional sub-tags can be inserted in the text content itself to 
require the generation, at the insertion point, of mathematical *equations*, 
graphical *block-diagrams*, Faust source code *listing* and explanation 
*notice*.

<img src="img/equation.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

The generation of the mathematical equations of a Faust expression can be 
requested by placing this expression between an opening `<equation>` and a 
closing `</equation>` tag. The expression is evaluated within the lexical 
context of the Faust program.

<img src="img/diagram.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

Similarly, the generation of the graphical block-diagram of a Faust expression 
can be requested by placing this expression between an opening `<diagram>` and 
a closing `</diagram>` tag. The expression is evaluated within the lexical 
context of the Faust program.

<img src="img/metadata.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

The `<metadata>` tags allow to reference Faust 
[metadata declarations](#metadata-declarations), calling the corresponding 
keyword.

<img src="img/notice.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

The `<notice/>` empty-element tag is used to generate the conventions used in 
the mathematical equations.

<img src="img/listing.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

The `<listing/>` empty-element tag is used to generate the listing of the 
Faust program. Its three attributes `mdoctags`, `dependencies`, and 
`distributed` enable or disable respectively `<mdoc>` tags, other files 
dependencies and distribution of interleaved Faust code between 
`<mdoc>` sections.

## Definitions

A *definition* associates an identifier with an expression. Definitions are 
essentially a convenient shortcut avoiding to type long expressions. During 
compilation, more precisely during the evaluation stage, identifiers are 
replaced by their definitions. It is therefore always equivalent to use an 
identifier or directly its definition. Please note that multiple definitions of 
a same identifier are not allowed, unless it is a pattern matching based 
definition.

### Simple Definitions

The syntax of a simple definition is:

```
identifier = expression ;
```

For example here is the definition of `random`, a simple pseudo-random number 
generator:

```
random = +(12345) ~ *(1103515245);
```

## Function Definitions

Definitions with formal parameters correspond to functions definitions.

<img src="img/listing.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example the definition of `linear2db`, a function that converts linear 
values to decibels, is:

```
linear2db(x) = 20*log10(x);
```
 
Please note that this notation is only a convenient alternative to the direct 
use of [*lambda-abstractions*](#abstractions) (also called anonymous 
functions). The following is an equivalent definition of `linear2db` using a 
lambda-abstraction:

```
linear2db = \(x).(20*log10(x));
```

## Definitions with pattern matching

Moreover, formal parameters can also be full expressions representing patterns. 

<img src="img/listing.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

This powerful mechanism allows to algorithmically create and manipulate block 
diagrams expressions. Let's say that you want to describe a function to 
duplicate an expression several times in parallel:

```
duplicate(1,x) = x;
duplicate(n,x) = x, duplicate(n-1,x);
```

Note that this last definition is a convenient alternative to the more verbose:

```
duplicate = case { 
  (1,x) => x; 
  (n,x) => duplicate(n-1,x); 
};
```

A use case for `duplicate` could be to put 5 white noise generators in 
parallel:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
duplicate(1,x) = x;
duplicate(n,x) = x, duplicate(n-1,x);
process = duplicate(5,no.noise);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Here is another example to count the number of elements of a list. Please note 
that we simulate lists using [parallel composition](#parallel-composition): 
`(1,2,3,5,7,11)`. The main limitation of this approach is that there is no 
empty list. Moreover lists of only one element are represented by this element:

```
count((x,xs)) = 1+count(xs);
count(x) = 1;
```

If we now write `count(duplicate(10,666))`, the expression will be evaluated as 
`10`.

Note that the order of pattern matching rules matters. The more specific rules 
must precede the more general rules. When this order is not respected, as in:

```
count(x) = 1;
count((x,xs)) = 1+count(xs);
```

the first rule will always match and the second rule will never be called.

## Expressions

Despite its textual syntax, Faust is conceptually a block-diagram language. 
Faust expressions represent DSP block-diagrams and are assembled from primitive 
ones using various *composition* operations. More traditional *numerical* 
expressions in infix notation are also possible. Additionally Faust provides 
time based expressions, like delays, expressions related to lexical 
environments, expressions to interface with foreign function and lambda 
expressions.

<img src="img/expression.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

### Diagram Expressions

Diagram expressions are assembled from primitive ones using either binary 
composition operations or high level iterative constructions.

<img src="img/diagramexp.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

#### Diagram Composition Operations 

Five binary *composition operations* are available to combine block-diagrams: 

* [*recursion*](#recursion-composition) (`~`),
* [*parallel*](#parallel-composition) (`,`),
* [*sequential*](#sequential-composition) (`:`),
* [*split*](#split-composition) (`<:`),
* [*merge*](#merge-composition) (`:>`).

One can think of each of these composition operations as a particular way to 
connect two block diagrams. 

<img src="img/diagcomposition.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

To describe precisely how these connections are done, we have to introduce some 
notation. The number of inputs and outputs of a block-diagram $A$ are expressed 
as $\mathrm{inputs}(A)$ and $\mathrm{outputs}(A)$. The inputs and outputs 
themselves are respectively expressed as: $[0]A$, $[1]A$, $[2]A$, $\ldots$ and 
$A[0]$, $A[1]$, $A[2]$, etc. 

For each composition operation between two block-diagrams $A$ and $B$ we will 
describe the connections $A[i]\rightarrow [j]B$ that are created and the 
constraints on their relative numbers of inputs and outputs.

The priority and associativity of this five operations are:

| Syntax                     | Priority  | Association  | Description             |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| `expression ~ expression`  | 4         | left         | Recursive Composition   |
| `expression , expression`  | 3         | right        | Parallel Composition    |
| `expression : expression`  | 2         | right        | Sequential Composition  |
| `expression <: expression` | 1         | right        | Split Composition       |
| `expression :> expression` | 1         | right        | Merge Composition       |

#### Parallel Composition

The *parallel composition* (e.g., `(A,B)`) is probably the simplest one. It 
places the two block-diagrams one on top of the other, without connections. The 
inputs of the resulting block-diagram are the inputs of `A` and `B`. The outputs 
of the resulting block-diagram are the outputs of `A` and `B`. 

*Parallel composition* is an associative operation: `(A,(B,C))` and `((A,B),C)` 
are equivalents. When no parenthesis are used (e.g., `A,B,C,D`), Faust uses 
right associativity and therefore builds internally the expression 
`(A,(B,(C,D)))`. This organization is important to know when using pattern 
matching techniques on parallel compositions. 

**Example: Oscillators in Parallel**

*Parallel composition* can be used to put 3 oscillators of different kinds
and frequencies in parallel, which will result in a Faust program with 3 
outputs:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = os.osc(440),os.sawtooth(550),os.triangle(660);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

**Example: Stereo Effect**

*Parallel composition* can be used to easily turn a mono effect into a stereo
one which will result in a Faust program with 2 inputs and 2 outputs:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
level = 1;
process = ve.autowah(level),ve.autowah(level);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that there's a better to write this last example using the 
[`par` iteration](#par-iteration): 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
level = 1;
process = par(i,2,ve.autowah(level));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### Sequential Composition

The *sequential composition*  (e.g., `A:B`) expects:

$$\mathrm{outputs}(A)=\mathrm{inputs}(B)$$ 

It connects each output of $A$ to the corresponding input of $B$: 

$$A[i]\rightarrow[i]B$$

*Sequential composition* is an associative operation: `(A:(B:C))` and 
`((A:B):C)` are equivalents. When no parenthesis are used, like in `A:B:C:D`, 
Faust uses right associativity and therefore builds internally the expression `(A:(B:(C:D)))`.

**Example: Sine Oscillator**

Since everything is considered as a signal generator in Faust, 
*sequential composition* can be simply used to pass an argument to a function:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = 440 : os.osc;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

**Example: Effect Chain**

*Sequential composition* can be used to create an audio effect chain. Here
we're plugging a guitar distortion to an autowah:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
drive = 0.6;
offset = 0;
autoWahLevel = 1;
process = ef.cubicnl(drive,offset) : ve.autowah(autoWahLevel);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### Split Composition

The *split composition* (e.g., `A<:B`) operator is used to distribute the 
outputs of $A$ to the inputs of $B$.

For the operation to be valid, the number of inputs of $B$ must be a multiple 
of the number of outputs of $A$: 

$$\mathrm{outputs}(A).k=\mathrm{inputs}(B)$$

Each input $i$ of $B$ is connected to the output $i \bmod k$ of $A$: 

$$A[i \bmod k]\rightarrow[i]B$$

**Example: Duplicating the Output of an Oscillator**

*Split composition* can be used to duplicate signals. For example, the output
of the following sawtooth oscillator is duplicated 3 times in parallel.

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = os.sawtooth(440) <: _,_,_;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that this can be written in a more effective way by replacing `_,_,_` with
`par(i,3,_)` using the [`par` iteration](#par-iteration).

**Example: Connecting a Mono Effect to a Stereo One**

More generally, the *split composition* can be used to connect a block with a 
certain number of output to a block with a greater number of inputs: 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
drive = 0.6;
offset = 0;
process = ef.cubicnl(drive,offset) <: dm.zita_light;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that an arbitrary number of signals can be split, for example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
drive = 0.6;
offset = 0;
process = par(i,2,ef.cubicnl(drive,offset)) <: par(i,2,dm.zita_light);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Once again, the only rule with this is that in the expression `A<:B` the number 
of inputs of `B` has to be a multiple of the number of outputs of `A`.

<!-- TODO: make sure that signal distribution rules are explained somewhere
else in the doc -->

#### Merge Composition

The *merge composition* (e.g., `A:>B`) is the dual of the 
[*split composition*](#split-composition). The number of outputs of $A$ must be 
a multiple of the number of inputs of $B$: 

$$\mathrm{outputs}(A)=k.\mathrm{inputs}(B)$$

Each output $i$ of $A$ is connected to the input $i \bmod k$ of $B$ : 

$$A[i]\rightarrow\ [i \bmod k]B$$

The $k$ incoming signals of an input of $B$ are summed together.

**Example: Summing Signals Together - Additive Synthesis**

*Merge composition* can be used to sum an arbitrary number of signals together.
Here's an example of a simple additive synthesizer (note that the result of the
sum of the signals is divided by 3 to prevent clicking):

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,3000,0.01);
gain = hslider("gain",1,0,1,0.01);
gate = button("gate");
envelope = gain*gate : si.smoo;
process = os.osc(freq),os.osc(freq*2),os.osc(freq*3) :> /(3)*envelope;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

While the resulting block diagram will look slightly different, this is 
mathematically equivalent to:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,3000,0.01);
gain = hslider("gain",1,0,1,0.01);
gate = button("gate");
envelope = gain*gate : si.smoo;
process = (os.osc(freq) + os.osc(freq*2) + os.osc(freq*3))/(3)*envelope;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

**Example: Connecting a Stereo Effect to a Mono One**

More generally, the *merge composition* can be used to connect a block with a 
certain number of output to a block with a smaller number of inputs: 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
drive = 0.6;
offset = 0;
process = dm.zita_light :> ef.cubicnl(drive,offset);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that an arbitrary number of signals can be split, for example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
drive = 0.6;
offset = 0;
process = par(i,2,dm.zita_light) :> par(i,2,ef.cubicnl(drive,offset));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Once again, the only rule with this is that in the expression `A:>B` the number 
of outputs of `A` has to be a multiple of the number of inputs of `B`.

#### Recursive Composition

The *recursive composition* (e.g., `A~B`) is used to create cycles in the 
block-diagram in order to express recursive computations. It is the most 
complex operation in terms of connections.

To be applicable, it requires that:

$$\mathrm{outputs}(A) \geq \mathrm{inputs}(B) and \mathrm{inputs}(A) \geq \mathrm{outputs}(B)$$

Each input of $B$ is connected to the corresponding output of $A$ via an 
implicit 1-sample delay :
 

$$A[i]\stackrel{Z^{-1}}{\rightarrow}[i]B$$
 
and each output of $B$ is connected to the corresponding input of $A$:

$$B[i]\rightarrow [i]A$$

The inputs of the resulting block diagram are the remaining unconnected inputs 
of $A$. The outputs are all the outputs of $A$.

**Example: Timer**

*Recursive composition* can be used to implement a "timer" that will count each
sample starting at time $n=0$:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = _~+(1);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

The difference equation corresponding to this program is:

$$y(n) = y(n-1) + 1$$

an its output signal will look like: $(1,2,3,4,5,6,\dots)$. 

**Example: One Pole Filter**

*Recursive composition* can be used to implement a one pole filter with one
line of code and just a few characters:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
a1 = 0.999; // the pole
process = +~*(a1);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

The difference equation corresponding to this program is:

$$y(n) = x(n) + a_{1}y(n-1)$$

Note that the one sample delay of the filter is implicit here so it doesn't
have to be declared.

#### Inputs and Outputs of an Expression

The number of inputs and outputs of a Faust expression can be known at compile
time simply by using `inputs(expression)` and `outputs(expression)`.

For example, the number of outputs of a sine wave oscillator can be known
simply by writing the following program:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = outputs(os.osc(440));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that Faust automatically simplified the expression by generating a program
that just outputs `1`.

This type of construction is useful to define high order functions and build 
algorithmically complex block-diagrams. Here is an example to automatically 
reverse the order of the outputs of an expression.

```
Xo(expr) = expr <: par(i,n,ba.selector(n-i-1,n)) 
with { 
  n = outputs(expr);
};
```

And the inputs of an expression :

```
Xi(expr) = si.bus(n) <: par(i,n,ba.selector(n-i-1,n)) : expr 
with { 
  n = inputs(expr); 
};
```

For example `Xi(-)` will reverse the order of the two inputs of the 
substraction:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
Xi(expr) = si.bus(n) <: par(i,n,ba.selector(n-i-1,n)) : expr 
with { 
  n = inputs(expr); 
};
toto = os.osc(440),os.sawtooth(440), os.triangle(440);
process = Xi(-);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### Iterations

Iterations are analogous to `for(...)` loops in other languages and provide a 
convenient way to automate some complex block-diagram constructions. 

<img src="img/diagiteration.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

The use and role of [`par`](#par-iteration), [`seq`](#seq-iteration), 
[`sum`](#sum-iteration), and  [`prod`](#prod-iteration) are detailed in the
following sections.

#### `par` Iteration

The `par` iteration can be used to duplicate an expression in parallel. Just
like other types of iterations in Faust: 

* its first argument is a variable name containing the number of the current 
iteration (a bit like the variable that is usually named `i` in a for loop)
starting at 0,
* its second argument is the number of iterations,
* its third argument is the expression to be duplicated.

**Example: Simple Additive Synthesizer**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,3000,0.01);
gain = hslider("gain",1,0,1,0.01);
gate = button("gate");
envelope = gain*gate : si.smoo;
nHarmonics = 4;
process = par(i,nHarmonics,os.osc(freq*(i+1))) :> /(nHarmonics)*envelope;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

`i` is used here at each iteration to compute the value of the frequency of the 
current oscillator. Also, note that this example could be re-wrtitten using 
[`sum` iteration](#sum-iteration) (see example in the corresponding section).

#### `seq` Iteration

The `seq` iteration can be used to duplicate an expression in series. Just
like other types of iterations in Faust: 

* its first argument is a variable name containing the number of the current 
iteration (a bit like the variable that is usually named `i` in a for loop)
starting at 0,
* its second argument is the number of iterations,
* its third argument is the expression to be duplicated.

**Example: Peak Equalizer**

The [`fi.peak_eq`](TODO) function of the Faust libraries implements a second
order "peak equalizer" section (gain boost or cut near some frequency). When
placed in series, it can be used to implement a full peak equalizer:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
nBands = 8;
filterBank(N) = hgroup("Filter Bank",seq(i,N,oneBand(i)))
with{
	oneBand(j) = vgroup("[%j]Band %a",fi.peak_eq(l,f,b))
	with{
		a = j+1; // just so that band numbers don't start at 0
		l = vslider("[2]Level[unit:db]",0,-70,12,0.01) : si.smoo;
		f = nentry("[1]Freq",(80+(1000*8/N*(j+1)-80)),20,20000,0.01) : si.smoo;
		b = f/hslider("[0]Q[style:knob]",1,1,50,0.01) : si.smoo;
	};
};
process = filterBank(nBands);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that `i` is used here at each iteration to compute various elements and
to format some labels. Having user interface elements with different names is
a way to force their differentiation in the generated interface.  

#### `sum` Iteration

The `sum` iteration can be used to duplicate an expression as a sum. Just
like other types of iterations in Faust: 

* its first argument is a variable name containing the number of the current 
iteration (a bit like the variable that is usually named `i` in a for loop)
starting at 0,
* its second argument is the number of iterations,
* its third argument is the expression to be duplicated.

**Example: Simple Additive Synthesizer**

The following example is just a slightly different version from the one 
presented in the [`par` iteration](#par-iteration) section. While their
block diagrams look slightly different, the generated code is exactly the
same.

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,3000,0.01);
gain = hslider("gain",1,0,1,0.01);
gate = button("gate");
envelope = gain*gate : si.smoo;
nHarmonics = 4;
process = sum(i,nHarmonics,os.osc(freq*(i+1)))/(nHarmonics)*envelope;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

`i` is used here at each iteration to compute the value of the frequency of the 
current oscillator.

#### `prod` Iteration

The `sum` iteration can be used to duplicate an expression as a product. Just
like other types of iterations in Faust: 

* its first argument is a variable name containing the number of the current 
iteration (a bit like the variable that is usually named `i` in a for loop)
starting at 0,
* its second argument is the number of iterations,
* its third argument is the expression to be duplicated.

**Example: Amplitude Modulation Synthesizer**

The following example implements an amplitude modulation synthesizer using
an arbitrary number of oscillators thanks to the `prod` iteration:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("[0]freq",440,50,3000,0.01);
gain = hslider("[1]gain",1,0,1,0.01);
shift = hslider("[2]shift",0,0,1,0.01);
gate = button("[3]gate");
envelope = gain*gate : si.smoo;
nOscs = 4;
process = prod(i,nOscs,os.osc(freq*(i+1+shift)))*envelope;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

`i` is used here at each iteration to compute the value of the frequency of the 
current oscillator. Note that the `shift` parameter can be used to tune the
frequency drift between each oscillator.

### Infix Notation and Other Syntax Extensions

> Infix notation is commonly used in mathematics. It consists in placing the 
operand between the arguments as in $2+3$

Besides its algebra-based core syntax, Faust provides some syntax extensions, 
in particular the familiar *infix notation*. For example if you want to 
multiply two numbers, say `2` and `3`, you can write directly `2*3` instead of 
the equivalent core-syntax expression `2,3 : *`.

The *infix notation* is not limited to numbers or numerical expressions. 
Arbitrary expressions `A` and `B` can be used, provided that `A,B` has exactly 
two outputs. For example `_/2` is equivalent to `_,2:/` which divides the 
incoming signal by `2`. 

Here are a few examples of equivalences:

| Infix Syntax | | Core Syntax | 
| ----- | -------- | --------- |
| `2-3` | $\equiv$ | `2,3 : -` |
| `2*3` | $\equiv$ | `2,3 : *` |
| `_@7` | $\equiv$ | `_,7 : @` |
| `_/2` | $\equiv$ | `_,2 : /` |
| `A<B` | $\equiv$ | `A,B : <` |

In case of doubts on the meaning of an infix expression, for example `_*_`, it 
is useful to translate it to its core syntax equivalent, here `_,_:*`, which is 
equivalent to `*`.

#### Infix Operators

Built-in primitives that can be used in infix notation are called *infix 
operators* and are listed below. Please note that a more detailed description 
of these operators is available [section on primitives](#primitives). 

<img src="img/infixop.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

#### Prefix Notation

Beside *infix notation*, it is also possible to use *prefix notation*. 
The *prefix notation* is the usual mathematical notation for functions 
$f(x,y,z,\ldots)$, but extended to *infix operators*.
 
It consists in first having the operator, for example `/`, followed by its 
arguments between parentheses: `/(2,3)`: 
 
| Prefix Syntax | | Core Syntax |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| `*(2,3)` | $\equiv$ | `2,3 : *` |
| `@(_,7)` | $\equiv$ | `_,7 : @` |
| `/(_,2)` | $\equiv$ | `_,2 : /` |
| `<(A,B)` | $\equiv$ | `A,B : <` | 

#### Partial Application

The *partial application* notation is a variant of the *prefix notation* in 
which not all arguments are given. For instance `/(2)` (divide by 2), `^(3)` 
(rise to the cube), and `@(512)` (delay by 512 samples) are examples of partial 
applications where only one argument is given. The result of a partial 
application is a function that "waits" for the remaining arguments. 

When doing partial application with an *infix operator*, it is important to 
note that the supplied argument is not the first argument, but always the 
second one:

| Prefix Partial Application Syntax | | Core Syntax |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| `+(C)` | $\equiv$ | `_,C : *` |
| `-(C)` | $\equiv$ | `_,C : -` |
| `<(C)` | $\equiv$ | `_,C : <` |
| `/(C)` | $\equiv$ | `_,C : /` |

For commutative operations that doesn't matter. But for non-commutative ones, 
it is more "natural" to fix the second argument.  We use divide by 2 (`/(2)`) 
or rise to the cube (`^(3)`) more often than the other way around.

Please note that this rule only applies to infix operators, not to other 
primitives or functions. If you partially apply a regular function to a single 
argument, it will correspond to the first parameter.

**Example: Gain Controller**

The following example demonstrates the use of partial application in the
context of a gain controller:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
gain = hslider("gain",0.5,0,1,0.01);
process = *(gain);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

### `'` Time Expression

`'` is used to express a one sample delay. For example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = _';
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

will delay the incoming signal by one sample. 

`'` time expressions can be chained, so the output signal of this program:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = 1'';
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

will look like: $(0,0,1,1,1,1,\dots)$.

The `'` time expression is useful when designing filters, etc. and is 
equivalent to `@(1)` (see the [`@` Time Expression](#time-expression-1)).

### `@` Time Expression

`@` is used to express a delay with an arbitrary number of samples. For 
example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = @(10);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

will delay the incoming signal by 10 samples. 

A delay expressed with `@` doesn't have to be fixed but it must be positive 
and bounded. Therefore, the values of a slider are perfectly acceptable:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = @(hslider("delay",0,0,100,1));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

`@` only allows for the implementation of integer delay. Thus, various 
fractional delay algorithms are implemented in [the Faust libraries](TODO).

### Environment Expressions

Faust is a lexically scoped language. The meaning of a Faust expression is 
determined by its context of definition (its lexical environment) and not by 
its context of use. 

To keep their original meaning, Faust expressions are bounded to their lexical 
environment in structures called *closures*. The following constructions allow 
to explicitly create and access such environments. Moreover they provide 
powerful means to reuse existing code and promote modular design.

<img src="img/envexp.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

#### `with` Expression

The `with` construction allows to specify a *local environment*: a private list 
of definition that will be used to evaluate the left hand expression.

In the following example :

<!-- faust-run -->
```
pink = f : + ~ g 
with {
  f(x) = 0.04957526213389*x - 0.06305581334498*x' + 0.01483220320740*x'';
	g(x) = 1.80116083982126*x - 0.80257737639225*x';
};
process = pink;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

the definitions of `f(x)` and `g(x)` are local to `f : + ~ g`.

Please note that `with` is left associative and has the lowest priority:

* `f : + ~ g with {...}` is equivalent to `(f : + ~ g)  with {...}`. 
* `f : + ~ g with {...} with {...}` is equivalent to 
`((f : + ~ g)  with {...})  with {...}`. 

#### `letrec` Expression

The `letrec` construction is somehow similar to [`with`](#with-expression), but 
for difference equations instead of regular definitions. It allows us to easily 
express groups of mutually recursive signals, for example:

$$
x(t) = y(t-1) + 10\\
y(t) = x(t-1) - 1
$$

as `E letrec { 'x = y+10; 'y = x-1; }`	

The syntax is defined by the following rules:

<img src="img/letrec.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

Note the special notation `'x = y + 10` instead of `x = y' + 10`. It makes 
syntactically impossible to write non-sensical equations like `x=x+1`.

Here is a more involved example. Let say we want to define an envelope 
generator with an attack and a release time (as a number of samples), and a 
gate signal. A possible definition could be:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
ar(a,r,g) = v
letrec {
  'n = (n+1) * (g<=g');
  'v = max(0, v + (n<a)/a - (n>=a)/r) * (g<=g');
};
gate = button("gate");
process = os.osc(440)*ar(1000,1000,gate);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

With the following semantics for $n(t)$ and $v(t)$:

$$
n(t) = (n(t-1)+1) * (g(t) <= g(t-1))\\
v(t) = max(0, v(t-1) + (n(t-1)<a(t))/a(t) - (n(t-1)>=a(t))/r(t)) * (g(t)<=g(t-1))
$$

#### `environment` Expression

The `environment` construction allows to create an explicit environment. It is 
like a [`with'](#with-expression), but without the left hand expression. It is a 
convenient way to group together related definitions, to isolate groups of 
definitions and to create a name space hierarchy. 

<img src="img/environment.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

In the following example an `environment` construction is used to group 
together some constant definitions :

```
constant = environment {
  pi = 3.14159;
  e = 2,718;
	...
};
```

The  [`.` construction](#access-expression) allows to access the definitions of an 
environment (see next section).

#### Access Expression

Definitions inside an environment can be accessed using the `.` construction. 

<img src="img/access.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example `constant.pi` refers to the definition of `pi` in the `constant` 
environment [defined above](#environment-expression).

Note that environments don't have to be named. We could have written directly: 

```
environment{pi = 3.14159; e = 2,718;....}.pi
```

#### `library` Expression

The `library` construct allows to create an environment by reading the 
definitions from a file.

<img src="img/library.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example `library("filters.lib")` represents the 
[environment](#environment-expression) obtained by reading the file 
`filters.lib`. It works like [`import("miscfilter.lib")`](TODO) but all the 
read definitions are stored in a new separate lexical environment. Individual 
definitions can be accessed as described in the previous paragraph. For example 
`library("filters.lib").lowpass` denotes the function `lowpass` as defined in 
the file `miscfilter.lib`.

To avoid name conflicts when importing libraries it is recommended to prefer 
`library` to [`import`](TODO). So instead of :

```
import("filters.lib");
  ...
...lowpass....
	...
};
```

the following will ensure an absence of conflicts : 

```
fl = library("filters.lib");
  ...
...fl.lowpass....
	...
};
```

In practice, that's how the [`stdfaust.lib`](TODO) library works.

<!-- TODO: import? -->

<!-- TODO: we should also show how this type of construction can be used to
define function with variables with a predefined value, etc. -->

#### `component` Expression

The `component` construction allows us to reuse a full Faust program (e.g., a 
`.dsp` file) as a simple expression.

<img src="img/component.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example `component("freeverb.dsp")` denotes the signal processor defined 
in file `freeverb.dsp`. 
 
Components can be used within expressions like in: 
 
```
...component("karplus32.dsp") : component("freeverb.dsp")... 
```
  
Please note that `component("freeverb.dsp")` is equivalent to
`library("freeverb.dsp").process`.

`component` works well in tandem with 
[explicit substitution](#explicit-substitution) (see next section).

#### Explicit Substitution

Explicit substitution can be used to customize a component or any expression 
with a lexical environment by replacing some of its internal definitions, 
without having to modify it.

<img src="img/explicitsubst.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example we can create a customized version of `component("freeverb.dsp")`, 
with a different definition of `foo(x)`, by writing:

```
...component("freeverb.dsp")[foo(x) = ...;]...
};
```

### Foreign Expressions

Reference to external C *functions*, *variables* and *constants* can be 
introduced using the *foreign function* mechanism.

<img src="img/foreignexp.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

<!-- TODO something needs to be said about the fact that this is a C++ thing -->

#### `ffunction`

An external C function is declared by indicating its name and signature as well 
as the required include file. The file `maths.lib` of the Faust distribution 
contains several foreign function definitions, for example 
[the inverse hyperbolic sine function `asinh`](TODO):

```
asinh = ffunction(float asinh (float), <math.h>, "");
```

<!-- TODO: what happens for other languages than C? -->

Foreign functions with input parameters are considered pure math functions. 
They are therefore considered free of side effects and called only when their 
parameters change (that is at the rate of the fastest parameter). 

Exceptions are functions with no input parameters. A typical example is the C 
`rand()` function. In this case, the compiler generates code to call the 
function at sample rate.

#### Signature

The signature part (`float asinh (float)` in the example presented in 
[the previous section](#ffunction)) describes the prototype of the C function: 
return type, function name, and list of parameter types. Because the name of 
the foreign function can possibly depend on the floating point precision in 
use (float, double and quad), it is possible to give a different function name 
for each floating point precision using a signature with up to three function 
names. 

<img src="img/signature.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example in the declaration: 

```
asinh = ffunction(float asinhf|asinh|asinhl (float), <math.h>, "");
```

the signature `float asinhf|asinh|asinhl (float)` indicates to use the 
function name `asinhf` in single precision, `asinh` in double precision and 
`asinhl` in long double (quad) precision.

#### Types

Only numerical functions involving simple `int` and `float` parameters are 
allowed currently in Faust. No vectors, tables or data structures can be passed 
as parameters or returned.

#### Variables and Constants

External variables and constants can also be declared with a similar syntax. In 
the same `maths.lib` file, the definition of the sampling rate constant 
[`SR`](TODO) and the definition of the block-size variable [`BS`](TODO) can be 
found:

```
SR = min(192000.0,max(1.0,fconstant(int fSamplingFreq, <math.h>)));
BS = fvariable(int count, <math.h>);
```

Foreign constants are not supposed to vary. Therefore expressions involving 
only foreign constants are only computed once, during the initialization period. 

Variable are considered to vary at block speed. This means that expressions 
depending of external variables are computed every block.

#### File Include

In declaring foreign functions one has also to specify the include file. It 
allows the Faust compiler to add the corresponding `#include` in the generated 
code.

<img src="img/includefile.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

#### Library File

In declaring foreign functions one can possibly specify the library where the 
actual code is located. It allows the Faust compiler to (possibly) 
automatically link the library. Note that this feature is only used with the 
[LLVM backend in 'libfaust' dynamic library model](TODO).

<!-- TODO I feel like more could be said here -->

### Applications and Abstractions

*Abstractions* and *applications* are fundamental programming constructions 
directly inspired by Lambda-Calculus. These constructions provide powerful 
ways to describe and transform block-diagrams algorithmically.

<img src="img/abstraction.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

#### Abstractions

Abstractions correspond to functions definitions and allow to generalize a 
block-diagram by `making variable` some of its parts. 

Let's say we want to transform a stereo reverb, [`dm.zita_light`](TODO) for 
instance, into a mono effect. The following expression can be written 
(see the sections on [Split Composition](#split-composition) and 
[Merge Composition](#merge-composition)): 

```
_ <: dm.zita_light :> _ 
```

The incoming mono signal is split to feed the two input channels of the reverb, 
while the two output channels of the reverb are mixed together to produce the 
resulting mono output.

Imagine now that we are interested in transforming other stereo effects. We 
could generalize this principle by making `zita_light` a variable: 

```
\(zita_light).(_ <: zita_light :> _)
```

The resulting abstraction can then be applied to transform other effects. Note 
that if `zita_light` is a perfectly valid variable name, a more neutral name 
would probably be easier to read like:

```
\(fx).(_ <: fx :> _)
```
 
A name can be given to the abstraction and in turn use it on `dm.zita_light`:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
mono = \(fx).(_ <: fx :> _);
process = mono(dm.zita_light);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Or even use a more traditional, but equivalent, notation:

```
mono(fx) = _ <: fx :> _;
``` 

#### Applications

Applications correspond to function calls and allow to replace the variable 
parts of an abstraction with the specified arguments.

<img src="img/application.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example, the abstraction described in [the previous section](#abstractions) 
can be used to transform a stereo reverb:

```
mono(dm.zita_light)
```

The compiler will start by replacing `mono` by its definition:

```
\(fx).(_ <: fx :> _)(dm.zita_light)
```

> Replacing the *variable part* with the argument is called beta-reduction in 
Lambda-Calculus

Whenever the Faust compiler find an application of an abstraction it replaces 
the *variable part* with the argument. The resulting expression is as expected:

```
(_ <: dm.zita_light :> _)
```

#### Pattern Matching

Pattern matching rules provide an effective way to analyze and transform 
block-diagrams algorithmically.

<img src="img/patternabstraction.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example `case{ (x:y) => y:x; (x) => x; }` contains two rules. The first 
one will match a sequential expression and invert the two part. The second one 
will match all remaining expressions and leave it untouched. Therefore the 
application:

```
case{(x:y) => y:x; (x) => x;}(reverb : harmonizer)
```

will produce:

```
harmonizer : freeverb
```

Please note that patterns are evaluated before the pattern matching operation. 
Therefore only variables that appear free in the pattern are binding variables 
during pattern matching. 

<!-- TODO: I think we need a better example here: that's a bit weak. We should
wait to see if it appears somewhere else... Also, I think there are some stuff
missing here. -->

## Primitives

The primitive signal processing operations represent the built-in 
functionalities of Faust, that is the atomic operations on signals provided by 
the language. All these primitives denote *signal processors*, in other words, 
functions transforming *input signals* into *output signals*.

<!-- TODO: Diagram was removed here since everything is listed below: may be
we should put a table summarizing everything. --> 

### Numbers

Faust considers two types of numbers: *integers* and *floats*. Integers are 
implemented as 32-bits integers, and floats are implemented either with a 
simple, double, or extended precision depending of the compiler options. 
Floats are available in decimal or scientific notation. 

<img src="img/numbers.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

Like any other Faust expression, numbers are signal processors. For example the 
number 0.95 is a signal processor of type 
$\mathbb{S}^{0}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ that transforms an empty tuple of 
signals $()$ into a 1-tuple of signals $(y)$ such that 
$\forall t\in\mathbb{N}, y(t)=0.95$.

### The `waveform` Primitive

The waveform primitive was designed to facilitate the use of 
[`rdtable`](#rdtable) (read table). It allows us to specify a fixed periodic 
signal as a list of samples. 

`waveform` has two outputs:

* a constant and indicating the size (as a number of samples) of the period, 
* the periodic signal itself. 

<img src="img/waveform.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example `waveform{0,1,2,3}` produces two outputs: the constant signal 4 
and the periodic signal $(0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,\dots)$. 

In the following example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
triangleWave = waveform{0,0.5,1,0.5,0,-0.5,-1,-.5};
triangleOsc(f) = triangleWave,int(os.phasor(8,f)) : rdtable;
f = hslider("freq",440,50,2000,0.01);
process = triangleOsc(f);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->			

`waveform` is used to define a triangle waveform (in its most primitive form),
which is then used with a [`rdtable`](TODO) controlled by a phasor to
implement a triangle wave oscillator. Note that the quality of this oscillator
is very low because of the low resolution of the triangle waveform.

### The `soundfile` Primitive

<!-- -->

The `soundfile("label[url:path]", n)` primitive allows for the access of 
externally defined sound file/resource. `soundfile` has one input (the read 
index in the sound), three fixed outputs: 

* the audio wave length in frames
* the audio wave nominal sample rate
* the audio wave number of channels

and several more outputs for the audio channels themselves. 

If more outputs than the actual number of channels in the sound file are used, 
the audio channels will be automatically duplicated up to the wanted number of 
outputs (so for instance, if a stereo file is used with four output channels, 
the same group of two channels will be duplicated).

If the sound file cannot be loaded for whatever reason, a default sound with 
one channel, a length of 1024 frames and null outputs (with samples of value 
0) will be used. Note also that sound files are entirely loaded in memory by 
the architecture file.

Architecture files are responsible to load the actual soundfile. The 
`SoundUI` C++ class located in the `faust/gui/SoundUI.h` file in the 
[Faust repository](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust) implements the 
`void  addSoundfile(label, path, sf_zone)` method, which loads the actual 
soundfiles using the `libsndfile` library, and set up the `sf_zone` sound 
memory pointers. If *label* is used without any *url* metadata, it will be 
considered as the soundfile pathname. 

Note that a special architecture file can well decide to access and use 
sound resources created by another means (that is, not directly loaded from a 
sound file). For instance a mapping between labels and sound resources defined 
in memory could be used, with some additional code in charge of actually 
setting up all sound memory pointers when 
`void  addSoundfile(label, path, sf_zone)` is called by the `buidUserInterface` 
mechanism.

<!-- TODO: we need some working example here -->

### C-Equivalent Primitives

Most Faust primitives are analogous to their C counterpart but adapted to 
signal processing. For example `+` is a function of type 
$\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ that transforms a pair of 
signals $(x_1,x_2)$ into a 1-tuple of signals $(y)$ such that 
$\forall t\in\mathbb{N}, y(t)=x_{1}(t)+x_{2}(t)$. `+` can be used to 
very simply implement a mixer: 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = +;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

Note that this is equivalent to (see [Identity Function](#identity-function)):

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = _+_;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->		

The function `-` has type $\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ and 
transforms a pair of signals $(x_1,x_2)$ into a 1-tuple of signals $(y)$ 
such that $\forall t\in\mathbb{N}, y(t)=x_{1}(t)-x_{2}(t)$. 

**Be aware that** the unary `-` only exists in a limited form. It can be used 
with numbers: `-0.5` and variables: `-myvar`, but not with expressions 
surrounded by parenthesis, because in this case it represents a partial 
application.  For instance,  `-(a*b)` is a partial application. It is 
syntactic sugar for `_,(a*b) : -`. If you want to negate a complex 
term in parenthesis, you'll have to use `0 - (a*b)` instead.

<!-- TODO: need to make sure that the identify function and the exclamation
are properly documented/mentioned somewhere and demonstrated -->

### Delay Primitives and Modifiers

Faust hosts various modifiers and primitives to define one sample or integer
delay of arbitrary length. They are presented in this section.  

#### `mem` Primitive

A 1 sample delay can be expressed as `mem` in Faust.

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t+1)=x(t),y(0)=0$

**Example**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = mem;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

Note that this is equivalent to `process = _'` (see [`'` Modifier](#modifier))
and `process = @(1)` (see [`@` Primitive](TODO))

#### `'` Modifier

`'` can be used to apply a 1 sample delay to a signal in Faust. It can be seen
as syntactic sugar to the [`mem` primitive](#mem-primitive). `'` is very 
convenient when implementing filters and can help significantly decrease the 
size of the Faust code.

**Example**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = _';
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### `@` Primitive

An integer delay of `N` samples can be expressed as `@(N)` in Faust. Note that
`N` can be dynamic but that its range must be bounded. This can be done by
using a UI primitive (see example below) allowing for the definition of a 
range such as [`hslider`](TODO), [`vslider`](TODO), or [`nentry`](TODO).

Note that floating point delay is also available in Faust by the mean of
[various fractional delay implementations](TODO) available in the Faust 
standard libraries.

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t+x_{2}(t))=x_{1}(t), y(t<x_{2}(t))=0$

**Example: Static N Samples Delay**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
N = 10;
process = @(N);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

**Example: Dynamic N Samples Delay**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
N = hslider("N",10,1,10,1);
process = @(N);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

### Table Primitives

TODO

#### `rtable` Primitive

The `rtable` primitive can be used to read through a read-only (pre-defined
before compilation) table. The table can either be implemented using a 
function controlled by a timer as demonstrated in the first example or by using
the `waveform` primitive (as shown in the second example).

`rtable(n,s,r)` has three arguments such that:

* `n`: the table size
* `s`: the table
* `r`: the read index (an `int` between 0 and `n`)

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{3}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=T[r(t)]$

**Example: Basic Triangle Wave Oscillator Using the `waveform` Primitive**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
