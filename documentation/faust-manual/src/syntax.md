# Faust Syntax

<!-- TODO we should make a new introductory figure here and add some comments
about it. It'd be nice to make it interactive so that when people click on it,
they are brought to the right section. -->

## Faust Program

A Faust program is essentially a list of *statements*. These statements can be 
*metadata declarations* (either [global metadata](#global-metadata) or
[function metadata](#function-metadata)), [*imports*](#imports), 
[*definitions*](#definitions), and [*documentation tags*](#documentation-tags), 
with optional C++ style (`//...` and `/*...*/`) comments.

Here is a short Faust program that implements of a simple noise generator 
(called from the `noises.lib` Faust library). It exhibits various kind of 
statements : two [*global metadata*](#global-metadata) declarations, an 
[*imports*](#imports), a *comment*, and a [*definition*](#definitions). We will 
study later how [*documentation statements*](#documentation-tags) work:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
declare name "Noise";
declare copyright "(c)GRAME 2018";

import("stdfaust.lib");

// noise level controlled by a slider
process = no.noise * hslider("gain",0,0,1, 0.1);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

The keyword `process` is the equivalent of `main` in C/C++. Any Faust program, 
to be valid, must at least define `process`.

## Statements

The *statements* of a Faust program are of four kinds: 

* *metadata declarations*, 
* *file imports*, 
* *definitions*,
* *documentation*. 

All statements but *documentation* end with a semicolon `;`. 

### Metadata

Metadata allow us to add elements which are not part of the language to Faust 
code. These can range to the name of a Faust program, its author, to potential
compilation options or user interface element customizations.

There are three different types of metadata in Faust:

* [Global Metadata](#global-metadata): metadata global to a Faust code
* [Function Metadata](#function-metadata): metadata specific to a function
* [UI Metadata](#ui-label-metadata): metadata specific to a UI element

Note that some [Global Metadata](#global-metadata) have standard names and can
be used for specific tasks. Their role is described in the 
[Standard Metadata](#standard-metadata) section.

### Global Metadata

All global metadata declaration in Faust start with `declare`, followed by a 
key and a string. For example:

```
declare name "Noise";
```

allows us to specify the name of a Faust program in its whole. 

Unlike regular comments, metadata declarations will appear in the C++ code 
generated by the Faust compiler. A good practice is to start a Faust program 
with some standard declarations:

```
declare name "MyProgram";
declare author "MySelf";
declare copyright "MyCompany";
declare version "1.00";
declare license "BSD"; 
```

### Function Metadata

Metadata can be associated to a specific function. In that case, `declare` 
is followed by the name of the function, a key, and a string. For example:

```
declare add author "John Doe"
add = +;
```

This is very useful when a library has several contributors and that functions
potentially have different license terms, etc. 

### Standard Metadata

There exists a series of standard [global metadata](#global-metadata) in Faust
whose role role is described in the following table:

| Metadata | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `declare options "[key0:value][key1:value]"` | This metadata can be used to specify various options associated to a Faust code such as the fact its polyphonic, if it should have OSC, MIDI support, etc. Specific `keys` usable with this metadata are described throughout this documentation. | 
| `declare interface "xxx"` | Specifies an interface replacing the standard Faust UI. |

<!-- TODO: some are missing here: incomplete -->

### Imports

File imports allow us to import definitions from other source files.  

For example `import("maths.lib");` imports the definitions of the 
[`maths.lib`](TODO) library.

The most common file to be imported is the `stdfaust.lib` library which gives
access to all the standard Faust libraries from a single point:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = os.osc(440); // the "hello world" of computer music
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

### Documentation Tags

Documentation statements are optional and typically used to control the 
generation of the mathematical documentation of a Faust program. This 
documentation system is detailed in the 
[Mathematical Documentation](#mathematical-documentation) chapter. In this 
section we essentially describe the documentation statements syntax.

A documentation statement starts with an opening `<mdoc>` tag and ends with a 
closing `</mdoc>` tag. Free text content, typically in Latex format, can be 
placed in between these two tags. <!-- Why not markdown? -->

<img src="img/documentation.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

Moreover, optional sub-tags can be inserted in the text content itself to 
require the generation, at the insertion point, of mathematical *equations*, 
graphical *block-diagrams*, Faust source code *listing* and explanation 
*notice*.

<img src="img/equation.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

The generation of the mathematical equations of a Faust expression can be 
requested by placing this expression between an opening `<equation>` and a 
closing `</equation>` tag. The expression is evaluated within the lexical 
context of the Faust program.

<img src="img/diagram.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

Similarly, the generation of the graphical block-diagram of a Faust expression 
can be requested by placing this expression between an opening `<diagram>` and 
a closing `</diagram>` tag. The expression is evaluated within the lexical 
context of the Faust program.

<img src="img/metadata.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

The `<metadata>` tags allow to reference Faust 
[global metadatas](#global-metadata), calling the corresponding 
keyword.

<img src="img/notice.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

The `<notice/>` empty-element tag is used to generate the conventions used in 
the mathematical equations.

<img src="img/listing.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

The `<listing/>` empty-element tag is used to generate the listing of the 
Faust program. Its three attributes `mdoctags`, `dependencies`, and 
`distributed` enable or disable respectively `<mdoc>` tags, other files 
dependencies and distribution of interleaved Faust code between 
`<mdoc>` sections.

## Definitions

A *definition* associates an identifier with an expression. Definitions are 
essentially a convenient shortcut avoiding to type long expressions. During 
compilation, more precisely during the evaluation stage, identifiers are 
replaced by their definitions. It is therefore always equivalent to use an 
identifier or directly its definition. Please note that multiple definitions of 
a same identifier are not allowed, unless it is a pattern matching based 
definition.

### Simple Definitions

The syntax of a simple definition is:

```
identifier = expression ;
```

For example here is the definition of `random`, a simple pseudo-random number 
generator:

```
random = +(12345) ~ *(1103515245);
```

## Function Definitions

Definitions with formal parameters correspond to functions definitions.

<img src="img/listing.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example the definition of `linear2db`, a function that converts linear 
values to decibels, is:

```
linear2db(x) = 20*log10(x);
```
 
Please note that this notation is only a convenient alternative to the direct 
use of [*lambda-abstractions*](#abstractions) (also called anonymous 
functions). The following is an equivalent definition of `linear2db` using a 
lambda-abstraction:

```
linear2db = \(x).(20*log10(x));
```

## Definitions with pattern matching

Moreover, formal parameters can also be full expressions representing patterns. 

<img src="img/listing.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

This powerful mechanism allows to algorithmically create and manipulate block 
diagrams expressions. Let's say that you want to describe a function to 
duplicate an expression several times in parallel:

```
duplicate(1,x) = x;
duplicate(n,x) = x, duplicate(n-1,x);
```

Note that this last definition is a convenient alternative to the more verbose:

```
duplicate = case { 
  (1,x) => x; 
  (n,x) => duplicate(n-1,x); 
};
```

A use case for `duplicate` could be to put 5 white noise generators in 
parallel:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
duplicate(1,x) = x;
duplicate(n,x) = x, duplicate(n-1,x);
process = duplicate(5,no.noise);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Here is another example to count the number of elements of a list. Please note 
that we simulate lists using [parallel composition](#parallel-composition): 
`(1,2,3,5,7,11)`. The main limitation of this approach is that there is no 
empty list. Moreover lists of only one element are represented by this element:

```
count((x,xs)) = 1+count(xs);
count(x) = 1;
```

If we now write `count(duplicate(10,666))`, the expression will be evaluated as 
`10`.

Note that the order of pattern matching rules matters. The more specific rules 
must precede the more general rules. When this order is not respected, as in:

```
count(x) = 1;
count((x,xs)) = 1+count(xs);
```

the first rule will always match and the second rule will never be called.

## Expressions

Despite its textual syntax, Faust is conceptually a block-diagram language. 
Faust expressions represent DSP block-diagrams and are assembled from primitive 
ones using various *composition* operations. More traditional *numerical* 
expressions in infix notation are also possible. Additionally Faust provides 
time based expressions, like delays, expressions related to lexical 
environments, expressions to interface with foreign function and lambda 
expressions.

<img src="img/expression.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

### Diagram Expressions

Diagram expressions are assembled from primitive ones using either binary 
composition operations or high level iterative constructions.

<img src="img/diagramexp.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

#### Diagram Composition Operations 

Five binary *composition operations* are available to combine block-diagrams: 

* [*recursion*](#recursion-composition) (`~`),
* [*parallel*](#parallel-composition) (`,`),
* [*sequential*](#sequential-composition) (`:`),
* [*split*](#split-composition) (`<:`),
* [*merge*](#merge-composition) (`:>`).

One can think of each of these composition operations as a particular way to 
connect two block diagrams. 

<img src="img/diagcomposition.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

To describe precisely how these connections are done, we have to introduce some 
notation. The number of inputs and outputs of a block-diagram $A$ are expressed 
as $\mathrm{inputs}(A)$ and $\mathrm{outputs}(A)$. The inputs and outputs 
themselves are respectively expressed as: $[0]A$, $[1]A$, $[2]A$, $\ldots$ and 
$A[0]$, $A[1]$, $A[2]$, etc. 

For each composition operation between two block-diagrams $A$ and $B$ we will 
describe the connections $A[i]\rightarrow [j]B$ that are created and the 
constraints on their relative numbers of inputs and outputs.

The priority and associativity of this five operations are:

| Syntax                     | Priority  | Association  | Description             |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| `expression ~ expression`  | 4         | left         | Recursive Composition   |
| `expression , expression`  | 3         | right        | Parallel Composition    |
| `expression : expression`  | 2         | right        | Sequential Composition  |
| `expression <: expression` | 1         | right        | Split Composition       |
| `expression :> expression` | 1         | right        | Merge Composition       |

#### Parallel Composition

The *parallel composition* (e.g., `(A,B)`) is probably the simplest one. It 
places the two block-diagrams one on top of the other, without connections. The 
inputs of the resulting block-diagram are the inputs of `A` and `B`. The outputs 
of the resulting block-diagram are the outputs of `A` and `B`. 

*Parallel composition* is an associative operation: `(A,(B,C))` and `((A,B),C)` 
are equivalents. When no parenthesis are used (e.g., `A,B,C,D`), Faust uses 
right associativity and therefore builds internally the expression 
`(A,(B,(C,D)))`. This organization is important to know when using pattern 
matching techniques on parallel compositions. 

**Example: Oscillators in Parallel**

*Parallel composition* can be used to put 3 oscillators of different kinds
and frequencies in parallel, which will result in a Faust program with 3 
outputs:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = os.osc(440),os.sawtooth(550),os.triangle(660);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

**Example: Stereo Effect**

*Parallel composition* can be used to easily turn a mono effect into a stereo
one which will result in a Faust program with 2 inputs and 2 outputs:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
level = 1;
process = ve.autowah(level),ve.autowah(level);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that there's a better to write this last example using the 
[`par` iteration](#par-iteration): 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
level = 1;
process = par(i,2,ve.autowah(level));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### Sequential Composition

The *sequential composition*  (e.g., `A:B`) expects:

$$\mathrm{outputs}(A)=\mathrm{inputs}(B)$$ 

It connects each output of $A$ to the corresponding input of $B$: 

$$A[i]\rightarrow[i]B$$

*Sequential composition* is an associative operation: `(A:(B:C))` and 
`((A:B):C)` are equivalents. When no parenthesis are used, like in `A:B:C:D`, 
Faust uses right associativity and therefore builds internally the expression `(A:(B:(C:D)))`.

**Example: Sine Oscillator**

Since everything is considered as a signal generator in Faust, 
*sequential composition* can be simply used to pass an argument to a function:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = 440 : os.osc;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

**Example: Effect Chain**

*Sequential composition* can be used to create an audio effect chain. Here
we're plugging a guitar distortion to an autowah:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
drive = 0.6;
offset = 0;
autoWahLevel = 1;
process = ef.cubicnl(drive,offset) : ve.autowah(autoWahLevel);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### Split Composition

The *split composition* (e.g., `A<:B`) operator is used to distribute the 
outputs of $A$ to the inputs of $B$.

For the operation to be valid, the number of inputs of $B$ must be a multiple 
of the number of outputs of $A$: 

$$\mathrm{outputs}(A).k=\mathrm{inputs}(B)$$

Each input $i$ of $B$ is connected to the output $i \bmod k$ of $A$: 

$$A[i \bmod k]\rightarrow[i]B$$

**Example: Duplicating the Output of an Oscillator**

*Split composition* can be used to duplicate signals. For example, the output
of the following sawtooth oscillator is duplicated 3 times in parallel.

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = os.sawtooth(440) <: _,_,_;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that this can be written in a more effective way by replacing `_,_,_` with
`par(i,3,_)` using the [`par` iteration](#par-iteration).

**Example: Connecting a Mono Effect to a Stereo One**

More generally, the *split composition* can be used to connect a block with a 
certain number of output to a block with a greater number of inputs: 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
drive = 0.6;
offset = 0;
process = ef.cubicnl(drive,offset) <: dm.zita_light;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that an arbitrary number of signals can be split, for example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
drive = 0.6;
offset = 0;
process = par(i,2,ef.cubicnl(drive,offset)) <: par(i,2,dm.zita_light);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Once again, the only rule with this is that in the expression `A<:B` the number 
of inputs of `B` has to be a multiple of the number of outputs of `A`.

<!-- TODO: make sure that signal distribution rules are explained somewhere
else in the doc -->

#### Merge Composition

The *merge composition* (e.g., `A:>B`) is the dual of the 
[*split composition*](#split-composition). The number of outputs of $A$ must be 
a multiple of the number of inputs of $B$: 

$$\mathrm{outputs}(A)=k.\mathrm{inputs}(B)$$

Each output $i$ of $A$ is connected to the input $i \bmod k$ of $B$ : 

$$A[i]\rightarrow\ [i \bmod k]B$$

The $k$ incoming signals of an input of $B$ are summed together.

**Example: Summing Signals Together - Additive Synthesis**

*Merge composition* can be used to sum an arbitrary number of signals together.
Here's an example of a simple additive synthesizer (note that the result of the
sum of the signals is divided by 3 to prevent clicking):

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,3000,0.01);
gain = hslider("gain",1,0,1,0.01);
gate = button("gate");
envelope = gain*gate : si.smoo;
process = os.osc(freq),os.osc(freq*2),os.osc(freq*3) :> /(3)*envelope;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

While the resulting block diagram will look slightly different, this is 
mathematically equivalent to:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,3000,0.01);
gain = hslider("gain",1,0,1,0.01);
gate = button("gate");
envelope = gain*gate : si.smoo;
process = (os.osc(freq) + os.osc(freq*2) + os.osc(freq*3))/(3)*envelope;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

**Example: Connecting a Stereo Effect to a Mono One**

More generally, the *merge composition* can be used to connect a block with a 
certain number of output to a block with a smaller number of inputs: 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
drive = 0.6;
offset = 0;
process = dm.zita_light :> ef.cubicnl(drive,offset);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that an arbitrary number of signals can be split, for example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
drive = 0.6;
offset = 0;
process = par(i,2,dm.zita_light) :> par(i,2,ef.cubicnl(drive,offset));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Once again, the only rule with this is that in the expression `A:>B` the number 
of outputs of `A` has to be a multiple of the number of inputs of `B`.

#### Recursive Composition

The *recursive composition* (e.g., `A~B`) is used to create cycles in the 
block-diagram in order to express recursive computations. It is the most 
complex operation in terms of connections.

To be applicable, it requires that:

$$\mathrm{outputs}(A) \geq \mathrm{inputs}(B) and \mathrm{inputs}(A) \geq \mathrm{outputs}(B)$$

Each input of $B$ is connected to the corresponding output of $A$ via an 
implicit 1-sample delay :
 

$$A[i]\stackrel{Z^{-1}}{\rightarrow}[i]B$$
 
and each output of $B$ is connected to the corresponding input of $A$:

$$B[i]\rightarrow [i]A$$

The inputs of the resulting block diagram are the remaining unconnected inputs 
of $A$. The outputs are all the outputs of $A$.

**Example: Timer**

*Recursive composition* can be used to implement a "timer" that will count each
sample starting at time $n=0$:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = _~+(1);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

The difference equation corresponding to this program is:

$$y(n) = y(n-1) + 1$$

an its output signal will look like: $(1,2,3,4,5,6,\dots)$. 

**Example: One Pole Filter**

*Recursive composition* can be used to implement a one pole filter with one
line of code and just a few characters:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
a1 = 0.999; // the pole
process = +~*(a1);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

The difference equation corresponding to this program is:

$$y(n) = x(n) + a_{1}y(n-1)$$

Note that the one sample delay of the filter is implicit here so it doesn't
have to be declared.

#### Inputs and Outputs of an Expression

The number of inputs and outputs of a Faust expression can be known at compile
time simply by using `inputs(expression)` and `outputs(expression)`.

For example, the number of outputs of a sine wave oscillator can be known
simply by writing the following program:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = outputs(os.osc(440));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that Faust automatically simplified the expression by generating a program
that just outputs `1`.

This type of construction is useful to define high order functions and build 
algorithmically complex block-diagrams. Here is an example to automatically 
reverse the order of the outputs of an expression.

```
Xo(expr) = expr <: par(i,n,ba.selector(n-i-1,n)) 
with { 
  n = outputs(expr);
};
```

And the inputs of an expression :

```
Xi(expr) = si.bus(n) <: par(i,n,ba.selector(n-i-1,n)) : expr 
with { 
  n = inputs(expr); 
};
```

For example `Xi(-)` will reverse the order of the two inputs of the 
substraction:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
Xi(expr) = si.bus(n) <: par(i,n,ba.selector(n-i-1,n)) : expr 
with { 
  n = inputs(expr); 
};
toto = os.osc(440),os.sawtooth(440), os.triangle(440);
process = Xi(-);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### Iterations

Iterations are analogous to `for(...)` loops in other languages and provide a 
convenient way to automate some complex block-diagram constructions. 

<img src="img/diagiteration.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

The use and role of [`par`](#par-iteration), [`seq`](#seq-iteration), 
[`sum`](#sum-iteration), and  [`prod`](#prod-iteration) are detailed in the
following sections.

#### `par` Iteration

The `par` iteration can be used to duplicate an expression in parallel. Just
like other types of iterations in Faust: 

* its first argument is a variable name containing the number of the current 
iteration (a bit like the variable that is usually named `i` in a for loop)
starting at 0,
* its second argument is the number of iterations,
* its third argument is the expression to be duplicated.

**Example: Simple Additive Synthesizer**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,3000,0.01);
gain = hslider("gain",1,0,1,0.01);
gate = button("gate");
envelope = gain*gate : si.smoo;
nHarmonics = 4;
process = par(i,nHarmonics,os.osc(freq*(i+1))) :> /(nHarmonics)*envelope;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

`i` is used here at each iteration to compute the value of the frequency of the 
current oscillator. Also, note that this example could be re-wrtitten using 
[`sum` iteration](#sum-iteration) (see example in the corresponding section).

#### `seq` Iteration

The `seq` iteration can be used to duplicate an expression in series. Just
like other types of iterations in Faust: 

* its first argument is a variable name containing the number of the current 
iteration (a bit like the variable that is usually named `i` in a for loop)
starting at 0,
* its second argument is the number of iterations,
* its third argument is the expression to be duplicated.

**Example: Peak Equalizer**

The [`fi.peak_eq`](TODO) function of the Faust libraries implements a second
order "peak equalizer" section (gain boost or cut near some frequency). When
placed in series, it can be used to implement a full peak equalizer:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
nBands = 8;
filterBank(N) = hgroup("Filter Bank",seq(i,N,oneBand(i)))
with{
	oneBand(j) = vgroup("[%j]Band %a",fi.peak_eq(l,f,b))
	with{
		a = j+1; // just so that band numbers don't start at 0
		l = vslider("[2]Level[unit:db]",0,-70,12,0.01) : si.smoo;
		f = nentry("[1]Freq",(80+(1000*8/N*(j+1)-80)),20,20000,0.01) : si.smoo;
		b = f/hslider("[0]Q[style:knob]",1,1,50,0.01) : si.smoo;
	};
};
process = filterBank(nBands);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that `i` is used here at each iteration to compute various elements and
to format some labels. Having user interface elements with different names is
a way to force their differentiation in the generated interface.  

#### `sum` Iteration

The `sum` iteration can be used to duplicate an expression as a sum. Just
like other types of iterations in Faust: 

* its first argument is a variable name containing the number of the current 
iteration (a bit like the variable that is usually named `i` in a for loop)
starting at 0,
* its second argument is the number of iterations,
* its third argument is the expression to be duplicated.

**Example: Simple Additive Synthesizer**

The following example is just a slightly different version from the one 
presented in the [`par` iteration](#par-iteration) section. While their
block diagrams look slightly different, the generated code is exactly the
same.

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,3000,0.01);
gain = hslider("gain",1,0,1,0.01);
gate = button("gate");
envelope = gain*gate : si.smoo;
nHarmonics = 4;
process = sum(i,nHarmonics,os.osc(freq*(i+1)))/(nHarmonics)*envelope;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

`i` is used here at each iteration to compute the value of the frequency of the 
current oscillator.

#### `prod` Iteration

The `sum` iteration can be used to duplicate an expression as a product. Just
like other types of iterations in Faust: 

* its first argument is a variable name containing the number of the current 
iteration (a bit like the variable that is usually named `i` in a for loop)
starting at 0,
* its second argument is the number of iterations,
* its third argument is the expression to be duplicated.

**Example: Amplitude Modulation Synthesizer**

The following example implements an amplitude modulation synthesizer using
an arbitrary number of oscillators thanks to the `prod` iteration:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("[0]freq",440,50,3000,0.01);
gain = hslider("[1]gain",1,0,1,0.01);
shift = hslider("[2]shift",0,0,1,0.01);
gate = button("[3]gate");
envelope = gain*gate : si.smoo;
nOscs = 4;
process = prod(i,nOscs,os.osc(freq*(i+1+shift)))*envelope;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

`i` is used here at each iteration to compute the value of the frequency of the 
current oscillator. Note that the `shift` parameter can be used to tune the
frequency drift between each oscillator.

### Infix Notation and Other Syntax Extensions

> Infix notation is commonly used in mathematics. It consists in placing the 
operand between the arguments as in $2+3$

Besides its algebra-based core syntax, Faust provides some syntax extensions, 
in particular the familiar *infix notation*. For example if you want to 
multiply two numbers, say `2` and `3`, you can write directly `2*3` instead of 
the equivalent core-syntax expression `2,3 : *`.

The *infix notation* is not limited to numbers or numerical expressions. 
Arbitrary expressions `A` and `B` can be used, provided that `A,B` has exactly 
two outputs. For example `_/2` is equivalent to `_,2:/` which divides the 
incoming signal by `2`. 

Here are a few examples of equivalences:

| Infix Syntax | | Core Syntax | 
| ----- | -------- | --------- |
| `2-3` | $\equiv$ | `2,3 : -` |
| `2*3` | $\equiv$ | `2,3 : *` |
| `_@7` | $\equiv$ | `_,7 : @` |
| `_/2` | $\equiv$ | `_,2 : /` |
| `A<B` | $\equiv$ | `A,B : <` |

In case of doubts on the meaning of an infix expression, for example `_*_`, it 
is useful to translate it to its core syntax equivalent, here `_,_:*`, which is 
equivalent to `*`.

#### Infix Operators

Built-in primitives that can be used in infix notation are called *infix 
operators* and are listed below. Please note that a more detailed description 
of these operators is available [section on primitives](#primitives). 

<img src="img/infixop.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

#### Prefix Notation

Beside *infix notation*, it is also possible to use *prefix notation*. 
The *prefix notation* is the usual mathematical notation for functions 
$f(x,y,z,\ldots)$, but extended to *infix operators*.
 
It consists in first having the operator, for example `/`, followed by its 
arguments between parentheses: `/(2,3)`: 
 
| Prefix Syntax | | Core Syntax |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| `*(2,3)` | $\equiv$ | `2,3 : *` |
| `@(_,7)` | $\equiv$ | `_,7 : @` |
| `/(_,2)` | $\equiv$ | `_,2 : /` |
| `<(A,B)` | $\equiv$ | `A,B : <` | 

#### Partial Application

The *partial application* notation is a variant of the *prefix notation* in 
which not all arguments are given. For instance `/(2)` (divide by 2), `^(3)` 
(rise to the cube), and `@(512)` (delay by 512 samples) are examples of partial 
applications where only one argument is given. The result of a partial 
application is a function that "waits" for the remaining arguments. 

When doing partial application with an *infix operator*, it is important to 
note that the supplied argument is not the first argument, but always the 
second one:

| Prefix Partial Application Syntax | | Core Syntax |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| `+(C)` | $\equiv$ | `_,C : *` |
| `-(C)` | $\equiv$ | `_,C : -` |
| `<(C)` | $\equiv$ | `_,C : <` |
| `/(C)` | $\equiv$ | `_,C : /` |

For commutative operations that doesn't matter. But for non-commutative ones, 
it is more "natural" to fix the second argument.  We use divide by 2 (`/(2)`) 
or rise to the cube (`^(3)`) more often than the other way around.

Please note that this rule only applies to infix operators, not to other 
primitives or functions. If you partially apply a regular function to a single 
argument, it will correspond to the first parameter.

**Example: Gain Controller**

The following example demonstrates the use of partial application in the
context of a gain controller:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
gain = hslider("gain",0.5,0,1,0.01);
process = *(gain);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

### `'` Time Expression

`'` is used to express a one sample delay. For example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = _';
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

will delay the incoming signal by one sample. 

`'` time expressions can be chained, so the output signal of this program:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = 1'';
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

will look like: $(0,0,1,1,1,1,\dots)$.

The `'` time expression is useful when designing filters, etc. and is 
equivalent to `@(1)` (see the [`@` Time Expression](#time-expression-1)).

### `@` Time Expression

`@` is used to express a delay with an arbitrary number of samples. For 
example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = @(10);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

will delay the incoming signal by 10 samples. 

A delay expressed with `@` doesn't have to be fixed but it must be bounded 
and cannot be negative. Therefore, the values of a slider are perfectly acceptable:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = @(hslider("delay",0,0,100,1));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

`@` only allows for the implementation of integer delay. Thus, various 
fractional delay algorithms are implemented in [the Faust libraries](TODO).

### Environment Expressions

Faust is a lexically scoped language. The meaning of a Faust expression is 
determined by its context of definition (its lexical environment) and not by 
its context of use. 

To keep their original meaning, Faust expressions are bounded to their lexical 
environment in structures called *closures*. The following constructions allow 
to explicitly create and access such environments. Moreover they provide 
powerful means to reuse existing code and promote modular design.

<img src="img/envexp.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

#### `with` Expression

The `with` construction allows to specify a *local environment*: a private list 
of definition that will be used to evaluate the left hand expression.

In the following example :

<!-- faust-run -->
```
pink = f : + ~ g 
with {
  f(x) = 0.04957526213389*x - 0.06305581334498*x' + 0.01483220320740*x'';
	g(x) = 1.80116083982126*x - 0.80257737639225*x';
};
process = pink;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

the definitions of `f(x)` and `g(x)` are local to `f : + ~ g`.

Please note that `with` is left associative and has the lowest priority:

* `f : + ~ g with {...}` is equivalent to `(f : + ~ g)  with {...}`. 
* `f : + ~ g with {...} with {...}` is equivalent to 
`((f : + ~ g)  with {...})  with {...}`. 

#### `letrec` Expression

The `letrec` construction is somehow similar to [`with`](#with-expression), but 
for difference equations instead of regular definitions. It allows us to easily 
express groups of mutually recursive signals, for example:

$$
x(t) = y(t-1) + 10\\
y(t) = x(t-1) - 1
$$

as `E letrec { 'x = y+10; 'y = x-1; }`	

The syntax is defined by the following rules:

<img src="img/letrec.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

Note the special notation `'x = y + 10` instead of `x = y' + 10`. It makes 
syntactically impossible to write non-sensical equations like `x=x+1`.

Here is a more involved example. Let say we want to define an envelope 
generator with an attack and a release time (as a number of samples), and a 
gate signal. A possible definition could be:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
ar(a,r,g) = v
letrec {
  'n = (n+1) * (g<=g');
  'v = max(0, v + (n<a)/a - (n>=a)/r) * (g<=g');
};
gate = button("gate");
process = os.osc(440)*ar(1000,1000,gate);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

With the following semantics for $n(t)$ and $v(t)$:

$$
n(t) = (n(t-1)+1) * (g(t) <= g(t-1))\\
v(t) = max(0, v(t-1) + (n(t-1)<a(t))/a(t) - (n(t-1)>=a(t))/r(t)) * (g(t)<=g(t-1))
$$

#### `environment` Expression

The `environment` construction allows to create an explicit environment. It is 
like a [`with'](#with-expression), but without the left hand expression. It is a 
convenient way to group together related definitions, to isolate groups of 
definitions and to create a name space hierarchy. 

<img src="img/environment.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

In the following example an `environment` construction is used to group 
together some constant definitions :

```
constant = environment {
  pi = 3.14159;
  e = 2,718;
	...
};
```

The  [`.` construction](#access-expression) allows to access the definitions of an 
environment (see next section).

#### Access Expression

Definitions inside an environment can be accessed using the `.` construction. 

<img src="img/access.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example `constant.pi` refers to the definition of `pi` in the `constant` 
environment [defined above](#environment-expression).

Note that environments don't have to be named. We could have written directly: 

```
environment{pi = 3.14159; e = 2,718;....}.pi
```

#### `library` Expression

The `library` construct allows to create an environment by reading the 
definitions from a file.

<img src="img/library.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example `library("filters.lib")` represents the 
[environment](#environment-expression) obtained by reading the file 
`filters.lib`. It works like [`import("miscfilter.lib")`](TODO) but all the 
read definitions are stored in a new separate lexical environment. Individual 
definitions can be accessed as described in the previous paragraph. For example 
`library("filters.lib").lowpass` denotes the function `lowpass` as defined in 
the file `miscfilter.lib`.

To avoid name conflicts when importing libraries it is recommended to prefer 
`library` to [`import`](TODO). So instead of :

```
import("filters.lib");
  ...
...lowpass....
	...
};
```

the following will ensure an absence of conflicts : 

```
fl = library("filters.lib");
  ...
...fl.lowpass....
	...
};
```

In practice, that's how the [`stdfaust.lib`](TODO) library works.

<!-- TODO: import? -->

<!-- TODO: we should also show how this type of construction can be used to
define function with variables with a predefined value, etc. -->

#### `component` Expression

The `component` construction allows us to reuse a full Faust program (e.g., a 
`.dsp` file) as a simple expression.

<img src="img/component.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example `component("freeverb.dsp")` denotes the signal processor defined 
in file `freeverb.dsp`. 
 
Components can be used within expressions like in: 
 
```
...component("karplus32.dsp") : component("freeverb.dsp")... 
```
  
Please note that `component("freeverb.dsp")` is equivalent to
`library("freeverb.dsp").process`.

`component` works well in tandem with 
[explicit substitution](#explicit-substitution) (see next section).

#### Explicit Substitution

Explicit substitution can be used to customize a component or any expression 
with a lexical environment by replacing some of its internal definitions, 
without having to modify it.

<img src="img/explicitsubst.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example we can create a customized version of `component("freeverb.dsp")`, 
with a different definition of `foo(x)`, by writing:

```
...component("freeverb.dsp")[foo(x) = ...;]...
};
```

### Foreign Expressions

Reference to external C *functions*, *variables* and *constants* can be 
introduced using the *foreign function* mechanism.

<img src="img/foreignexp.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

<!-- TODO something needs to be said about the fact that this is a C++ thing -->

#### `ffunction`

An external C function is declared by indicating its name and signature as well 
as the required include file. The file `maths.lib` of the Faust distribution 
contains several foreign function definitions, for example 
[the inverse hyperbolic sine function `asinh`](TODO):

```
asinh = ffunction(float asinh (float), <math.h>, "");
```

<!-- TODO: what happens for other languages than C? -->

Foreign functions with input parameters are considered pure math functions. 
They are therefore considered free of side effects and called only when their 
parameters change (that is at the rate of the fastest parameter). 

Exceptions are functions with no input parameters. A typical example is the C 
`rand()` function. In this case, the compiler generates code to call the 
function at sample rate.

#### Signature

The signature part (`float asinh (float)` in the example presented in 
[the previous section](#ffunction)) describes the prototype of the C function: 
return type, function name, and list of parameter types. Because the name of 
the foreign function can possibly depend on the floating point precision in 
use (float, double and quad), it is possible to give a different function name 
for each floating point precision using a signature with up to three function 
names. 

<img src="img/signature.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example in the declaration: 

```
asinh = ffunction(float asinhf|asinh|asinhl (float), <math.h>, "");
```

the signature `float asinhf|asinh|asinhl (float)` indicates to use the 
function name `asinhf` in single precision, `asinh` in double precision and 
`asinhl` in long double (quad) precision.

#### Types

Only numerical functions involving simple `int` and `float` parameters are 
allowed currently in Faust. No vectors, tables or data structures can be passed 
as parameters or returned.

#### Variables and Constants

External variables and constants can also be declared with a similar syntax. In 
the same `maths.lib` file, the definition of the sampling rate constant 
[`SR`](TODO) and the definition of the block-size variable [`BS`](TODO) can be 
found:

```
SR = min(192000.0,max(1.0,fconstant(int fSamplingFreq, <math.h>)));
BS = fvariable(int count, <math.h>);
```

Foreign constants are not supposed to vary. Therefore expressions involving 
only foreign constants are only computed once, during the initialization period. 

Variable are considered to vary at block speed. This means that expressions 
depending of external variables are computed every block.

#### File Include

In declaring foreign functions one has also to specify the include file. It 
allows the Faust compiler to add the corresponding `#include` in the generated 
code.

<img src="img/includefile.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

#### Library File

In declaring foreign functions one can possibly specify the library where the 
actual code is located. It allows the Faust compiler to (possibly) 
automatically link the library. Note that this feature is only used with the 
[LLVM backend in 'libfaust' dynamic library model](TODO).

<!-- TODO I feel like more could be said here -->

### Applications and Abstractions

*Abstractions* and *applications* are fundamental programming constructions 
directly inspired by Lambda-Calculus. These constructions provide powerful 
ways to describe and transform block-diagrams algorithmically.

<img src="img/abstraction.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

#### Abstractions

Abstractions correspond to functions definitions and allow to generalize a 
block-diagram by `making variable` some of its parts. 

Let's say we want to transform a stereo reverb, [`dm.zita_light`](TODO) for 
instance, into a mono effect. The following expression can be written 
(see the sections on [Split Composition](#split-composition) and 
[Merge Composition](#merge-composition)): 

```
_ <: dm.zita_light :> _ 
```

The incoming mono signal is split to feed the two input channels of the reverb, 
while the two output channels of the reverb are mixed together to produce the 
resulting mono output.

Imagine now that we are interested in transforming other stereo effects. We 
could generalize this principle by making `zita_light` a variable: 

```
\(zita_light).(_ <: zita_light :> _)
```

The resulting abstraction can then be applied to transform other effects. Note 
that if `zita_light` is a perfectly valid variable name, a more neutral name 
would probably be easier to read like:

```
\(fx).(_ <: fx :> _)
```
 
A name can be given to the abstraction and in turn use it on `dm.zita_light`:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
mono = \(fx).(_ <: fx :> _);
process = mono(dm.zita_light);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Or even use a more traditional, but equivalent, notation:

```
mono(fx) = _ <: fx :> _;
``` 

#### Applications

Applications correspond to function calls and allow to replace the variable 
parts of an abstraction with the specified arguments.

<img src="img/application.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example, the abstraction described in [the previous section](#abstractions) 
can be used to transform a stereo reverb:

```
mono(dm.zita_light)
```

The compiler will start by replacing `mono` by its definition:

```
\(fx).(_ <: fx :> _)(dm.zita_light)
```

> Replacing the *variable part* with the argument is called beta-reduction in 
Lambda-Calculus

Whenever the Faust compiler find an application of an abstraction it replaces 
the *variable part* with the argument. The resulting expression is as expected:

```
(_ <: dm.zita_light :> _)
```

#### Pattern Matching

Pattern matching rules provide an effective way to analyze and transform 
block-diagrams algorithmically.

<img src="img/patternabstraction.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example `case{ (x:y) => y:x; (x) => x; }` contains two rules. The first 
one will match a sequential expression and invert the two part. The second one 
will match all remaining expressions and leave it untouched. Therefore the 
application:

```
case{(x:y) => y:x; (x) => x;}(reverb : harmonizer)
```

will produce:

```
harmonizer : freeverb
```

Please note that patterns are evaluated before the pattern matching operation. 
Therefore only variables that appear free in the pattern are binding variables 
during pattern matching. 

<!-- TODO: I think we need a better example here: that's a bit weak. We should
wait to see if it appears somewhere else... Also, I think there are some stuff
missing here. -->

## Primitives

The primitive signal processing operations represent the built-in 
functionalities of Faust, that is the atomic operations on signals provided by 
the language. All these primitives denote *signal processors*, in other words, 
functions transforming *input signals* into *output signals*.

<!-- TODO: Diagram was removed here since everything is listed below: may be
we should put a table summarizing everything. --> 

### Numbers

Faust considers two types of numbers: *integers* and *floats*. Integers are 
implemented as 32-bits integers, and floats are implemented either with a 
simple, double, or extended precision depending of the compiler options. 
Floats are available in decimal or scientific notation. 

<img src="img/numbers.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

Like any other Faust expression, numbers are signal processors. For example the 
number 0.95 is a signal processor of type 
$\mathbb{S}^{0}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ that transforms an empty tuple of 
signals $()$ into a 1-tuple of signals $(y)$ such that 
$\forall t\in\mathbb{N}, y(t)=0.95$.

### `waveform` Primitive

The waveform primitive was designed to facilitate the use of 
[`rdtable`](#rdtable) (read table). It allows us to specify a fixed periodic 
signal as a list of samples. 

`waveform` has two outputs:

* a constant and indicating the size (as a number of samples) of the period, 
* the periodic signal itself. 

<img src="img/waveform.svg" class="mx-auto d-block">

For example `waveform{0,1,2,3}` produces two outputs: the constant signal 4 
and the periodic signal $(0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,\dots)$. 

In the following example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
triangleWave = waveform{0,0.5,1,0.5,0,-0.5,-1,-.5};
triangleOsc(f) = triangleWave,int(os.phasor(8,f)) : rdtable;
f = hslider("freq",440,50,2000,0.01);
process = triangleOsc(f);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->			

`waveform` is used to define a triangle waveform (in its most primitive form),
which is then used with a [`rdtable`](TODO) controlled by a phasor to
implement a triangle wave oscillator. Note that the quality of this oscillator
is very low because of the low resolution of the triangle waveform.

### `soundfile` Primitive

The `soundfile("label[url:path]", n)` primitive allows for the access of 
externally defined sound file/resource. `soundfile` has one input (the read 
index in the sound), three fixed outputs: 

* the audio wave length in frames
* the audio wave nominal sample rate
* the audio wave number of channels

and several more outputs for the audio channels themselves. 

If more outputs than the actual number of channels in the sound file are used, 
the audio channels will be automatically duplicated up to the wanted number of 
outputs (so for instance, if a stereo file is used with four output channels, 
the same group of two channels will be duplicated).

If the sound file cannot be loaded for whatever reason, a default sound with 
one channel, a length of 1024 frames and null outputs (with samples of value 
0) will be used. Note also that sound files are entirely loaded in memory by 
the architecture file.

Architecture files are responsible to load the actual soundfile. The 
`SoundUI` C++ class located in the `faust/gui/SoundUI.h` file in the 
[Faust repository](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust) implements the 
`void  addSoundfile(label, path, sf_zone)` method, which loads the actual 
soundfiles using the `libsndfile` library, and set up the `sf_zone` sound 
memory pointers. If *label* is used without any *url* metadata, it will be 
considered as the soundfile pathname. 

Note that a special architecture file can well decide to access and use 
sound resources created by another means (that is, not directly loaded from a 
sound file). For instance a mapping between labels and sound resources defined 
in memory could be used, with some additional code in charge of actually 
setting up all sound memory pointers when 
`void  addSoundfile(label, path, sf_zone)` is called by the `buidUserInterface` 
mechanism.

<!-- TODO: we need some working example here -->

### C-Equivalent Primitives

Most Faust primitives are analogous to their C counterpart but adapted to 
signal processing. For example `+` is a function of type 
$\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ that transforms a pair of 
signals $(x_1,x_2)$ into a 1-tuple of signals $(y)$ such that 
$\forall t\in\mathbb{N}, y(t)=x_{1}(t)+x_{2}(t)$. `+` can be used to 
very simply implement a mixer: 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = +;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

Note that this is equivalent to (see [Identity Function](#identity-function)):

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = _+_;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->		

The function `-` has type $\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ and 
transforms a pair of signals $(x_1,x_2)$ into a 1-tuple of signals $(y)$ 
such that $\forall t\in\mathbb{N}, y(t)=x_{1}(t)-x_{2}(t)$. 

**Be aware that** the unary `-` only exists in a limited form. It can be used 
with numbers: `-0.5` and variables: `-myvar`, but not with expressions 
surrounded by parenthesis, because in this case it represents a partial 
application.  For instance,  `-(a*b)` is a partial application. It is 
syntactic sugar for `_,(a*b) : -`. If you want to negate a complex 
term in parenthesis, you'll have to use `0 - (a*b)` instead.

<!-- TODO: need to make sure that the identify function and the exclamation
are properly documented/mentioned somewhere and demonstrated -->

#### Integer Number

Integer numbers are of type $\mathbb{S}^{0}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ in Faust
and can be described mathematically as $y(t)=n$.

**Example: DC Offset of 1**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = 1;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->		

#### Floating Point Number

Floating point numbers are of type $\mathbb{S}^{0}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ in 
Faust and can be described as $y(t)=n.m$.

**Example: DC Offset of 0.5**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = 0.5;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->		

#### Identity Function

The identity function is expressed in Faust with the `_` primitive. 

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=x(t)$

**Example: a Signal Passing Through**

In the following example, the `_` primitive is used to connect the single
audio input of a Faust program to its output:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = _;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### Cut Primitive

The cut primitive is expressed in Faust with `!`. It can be used to 
"stop"/terminate a signal.

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{0}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $\forall x\in\mathbb{S},(x)\rightarrow ()$

**Example: Stopping a Signal**

In the following example, the `!` primitive is used to stop one of two parallel
signals:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = 1,2 : !,_;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### `int` Primitive

The `int` primitive can be used to force the cast of a signal to int. It is 
of type $\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ and can be described 
mathematically as $y(t)=(int)x(t)$. This primitive is useful when declaring
indices to read in a table, etc.

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=(int)x(t)$

**Example: Simple Cast**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = 1.5 : int;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### `float` Primitive

The `float` primitive can be used to force the cast of a signal to float.

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=(float)x(t)$

**Example: Simple Cast**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = 1.5 : float;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### Add Primitive

The `+` primitive can be used to add two signals together. 

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=x_{1}(t)+x_{2}(t)$

**Example: Simple Mixer**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = +;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### Subtract Primitive

The `-` primitive can be used to subtract two signals. 

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=x_{1}(t)-x_{2}(t)$

**Example: Subtracting Two Input Signals**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = -;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### Multiply Primitive

The `*` primitive can be used to multiply two signals. 

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=x_{1}(t)*x_{2}(t)$

**Example: Multiplying a Signal by 0.5**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = *(0.5);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### Divide Primitive

The `/` primitive can be used to divide two signals. 

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=x_{1}(t)/{x_{2}(t)}$

**Example: Dividing a Signal by 2**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = ^(2);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### Power Primitive

The `^` primitive can be used to raise to the power of `N` a signal. 

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=x_{1}(t)^{x_{2}(t)}$

**Example: Power of Two of a Signal**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = ^(2);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### Modulo Primitive

The `%` primitive can be used to take the modulo of a signal. 

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=x_{1}(t)\%{x_{2}(t)}$

**Example: Phaser**

The following example uses a counter and the `%` primitive to implement a 
basic phaser:

<!-- TODO: say something about the fact that things are expressed in core
syntax -->

### Delay Primitives and Modifiers

Faust hosts various modifiers and primitives to define one sample or integer
delay of arbitrary length. They are presented in this section.  

#### `mem` Primitive

A 1 sample delay can be expressed as `mem` in Faust.

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t+1)=x(t),y(0)=0$

**Example**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = mem;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

Note that this is equivalent to `process = _'` (see [`'` Modifier](#modifier))
and `process = @(1)` (see [`@` Primitive](TODO))

#### `'` Modifier

`'` can be used to apply a 1 sample delay to a signal in Faust. It can be seen
as syntactic sugar to the [`mem` primitive](#mem-primitive). `'` is very 
convenient when implementing filters and can help significantly decrease the 
size of the Faust code.

**Example**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = _';
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### `@` Primitive

An integer delay of `N` samples can be expressed as `@(N)` in Faust. Note that
`N` can be dynamic but that its range must be bounded. This can be done by
using a UI primitive (see example below) allowing for the definition of a 
range such as [`hslider`](TODO), [`vslider`](TODO), or [`nentry`](TODO).

Note that floating point delay is also available in Faust by the mean of
[various fractional delay implementations](TODO) available in the Faust 
standard libraries.

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t+x_{2}(t))=x_{1}(t), y(t<x_{2}(t))=0$

**Usage**

```
_ : @(N) : _
```

Where:

* `N`: the length of the delay as a number of samples

**Example: Static N Samples Delay**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
N = 10;
process = @(N);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

**Example: Dynamic N Samples Delay**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
N = hslider("N",10,1,10,1);
process = @(N);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

### Table Primitives

TODO

#### `rdtable` Primitive

The `rdtable` primitive can be used to read through a read-only (pre-defined
before compilation) table. The table can either be implemented using a 
function controlled by a timer (such as [`ba.time`](TODO)) as demonstrated in 
the first example, or by using the `waveform` primitive (as shown in the 
second example). The idea is that the table is parsed during the initialization
step and before audio computation begins. 

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{3}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $y(t)=T[r(t)]$

**Usage**

```
rdtable(n,s,r) : _
```

Where:

* `n`: the table size
* `s`: the table
* `r`: the read index (an `int` between 0 and `n`)

**Example: Basic Triangle Wave Oscillator Using the `waveform` Primitive**

In this example, a basic (and dirty) triangle wave-table is defined using the 
[`waveform`](#waveform-primitive). It is then used with the `rdtable` primitive
and a phasor to implement a triangle wave oscillator. Note that the output of

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
triangleWave = waveform{0,0.5,1,0.5,0,-0.5,-1,-.5};
triangleOsc(f) = triangleWave,int(os.phasor(8,f)) : rdtable;
f = hslider("freq",440,50,2000,0.01);
process = triangleOsc(f);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

**Example: Basic Triangle Wave Oscillator Using the `waveform` Primitive**

In this example, a sine table is implemented using the 
[`sin` primitive](#sin-primitive) and a timer ([`ba.time`](TODO)). The timer 
parses the `sin` function during the initialization step of the Faust program.
It is then used with `rdtable` to implement a sine wave oscillator. 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
sineWave(tablesize) = float(ba.time)*(2.0*ma.PI)/float(tablesize) : sin;
tableSize = 1 << 16;
triangleOsc(f) = tableSize,sineWave(tableSize),int(os.phasor(tableSize,f)) : rdtable;
f = hslider("freq",440,50,2000,0.01);
process = triangleOsc(f);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### `rwtable` Primitive

The `rwtable` primitive can be used to implement a read/write table. It takes
an audio input that can be written in the table using a *record index* (i.e.,
`w` below) and read using a read index (i.e., `r` below).

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{5}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $T[w(t)]=c(t); y(t)=T[r(t)]$

**Usage**

```
_ : rwtable(n,s,w,_,r) : _
```

Where:

* `n`: the table size
* `s`: the table
* `w`: the write index (an `int` between 0 and `n`) 
* `r`: the read index (an `int` between 0 and `n`)

Note that the fourth argument of `rwtable` corresponds to the input of the 
table.

**Example: Simple Looper**

In this example, an input signal is written in the table when `record` is true
(equal to 1). The read index is constantly updated to loop through the table.
The table size is set to 48000, which corresponds to one second if the sampling
rate is 48000 KHz. 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
tableSize = 48000;
recIndex = (+(1) : %(tableSize)) ~ *(record);
readIndex = readSpeed/float(ma.SR) : (+ : ma.decimal) ~ _ : *(float(tableSize)) : int;
readSpeed = hslider("[0]Read Speed",1,0.001,10,0.01);
record = button("[1]Record") : int;
looper = rwtable(tableSize,0.0,recIndex,_,readIndex);
process = looper;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

<!-- TODO: we might want to have a better example here -->

### Selector Primitives

Selector primitives can be used to create conditions in Faust and to implement
switches to choose between several signals. Note that selector primitives
optimize the code generated by the Faust compiler by only computing the
selected signal.

#### `select2` Primitives

The `select2` primitive is a "two-ways selector" that can be used to select 
between 2 signals.

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{3}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $T[]=\{x_{0}(t),x_{1}(t)\}; y(t)=T[s(t)]$ 

**Usage**

```
_,_ : select2(s) : _,_
```

Where:

* `s`: the selector (`0` for the first signal, `1` for the second one)

**Example: Signal Selector**

The following example allows the user to choose between a sine and a sawtooth 
wave oscillator.  

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
s = nentry("Selector",0,0,1,1);
sig = os.osc(440),os.sawtooth(440) : select2(s);
process = sig;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

Note that `select2` could be easily implemented from scratch in Faust using
Boolean primitives:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
s = nentry("Selector",0,0,1,1);
mySelect2(s) = *(s==0),*(s==1) :> _;
sig = os.osc(440),os.sawtooth(440) : mySelect2(s);
process = sig;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

While the behavior of this last solution is identical to the first one, the
generated code will be less optimized as the sine and the sawtooth waves
will both be computed all the time.

#### `select3` Primitives

The `select3` primitive is a "three-ways selector" that can be used to select 
between 3 signals.

* **Type:** $\mathbb{S}^{4}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}$ 
* **Mathematical Description:** $T[]=\{x_{0}(t),x_{1}(t),x_{2}(t)\}; y(t)=T[s(t)]$ 

**Usage**

```
_,_,_ : select3(s) : _,_,_
```

Where:

* `s`: the selector (`0` for the first signal, `1` for the second one, `2` for
the third one)

**Example: Signal Selector**

The following example allows the user to choose between a sine, a sawtooth and 
a triangle wave oscillator.  

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
s = nentry("Selector",0,0,1,1);
sig = os.osc(440),os.sawtooth(440),os.triangle(440) : select3(s);
process = sig;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

Note that `select2` could be easily implemented from scratch in Faust using
Boolean primitives:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
s = nentry("Selector",0,0,2,1);
mySelect3(s) = *(s==0),*(s==1),*(s==2) :> _;
sig = os.osc(440),os.sawtooth(440),os.triangle(440) : mySelect3(s);
process = sig;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

While the behavior of this last solution is identical to the first one, the
generated code will be less optimized as the sine, the sawtooth and the 
triangle waves will all be computed all the time.

### User Interface Primitives and Configuration

Faust user interface widgets/primitives allow for an **abstract** description 
of a user interface from within the Faust code. This description is independent 
from any GUI toolkits/frameworks and is purely abstract. Widgets can be
**discrete** (e.g., [`button`](TODO), [`checkbox`](TODO), etc.), **continuous**
(e.g., [`hslider`](TODO), [`vslider`](TODO), [`nentry`](TODO)), and 
**organizational** (e.g., [`vgroup`](TODO), [`hgroup`](TODO)).

Discrete and continuous elements are signal generators. For example, a `button`
produces a signal which is 1 when the button is pressed and 0 otherwise: 

<img src="img/button.svg" class="mx-auto d-block" width="50%">

These signals can be freely combined with other audio signals. In fact, the
following code is perfectly valid and will generate sound:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = button("DC");
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

Each primitive implements a specific UI element, but their appearance can
also be completely modified using [metadata](TODO) (a little bit like HTML and
CSS in the web). Therefore, [`hslider`](TODO), [`vslider`](TODO), and 
[`nentry`](TODO)) can for example be turned into a knob, a dropdown menu, etc.
This concept is further developed in the [section on UI metadata](TODO).

Continuous UI elements (i.e., [`hslider`](TODO), [`vslider`](TODO), and 
[`nentry`](TODO)) must all declare a range for the parameter they're 
controlling. In some cases, this range is used during compilation to allocate
memory and will impact the generated code. For example, in the case of:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = @(hslider("N",1,1,10,1));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

a buffer of 10 samples will be allocated for the delay implemented with the 
[`@` primitive](#primitive) while 20 samples will be allocated in the 
following example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = @(hslider("N",1,1,20,1));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->	

#### `button` Primitive 

The `button` primitive implements a button.

**Usage**

```
button("label") : _
```

Where:

* `label`: the [label](#ui-labels-configuration) (expressed as a string) of the

**Example: Trigger**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = no.noise*button("gate");
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `checkbox` Primitive

element in the interface

**Example: Trigger**

process = no.noise*checkbox("gate");
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `hslider` Primitive

element in the interface
* `init`: the initial value of the slider
* `min`: the minimum value of the slider
* `max`: the maximum value of the slider
* `step`: the precision (step) of the slider (1 to count 1 by 1, 0.1 to count
0.1 by 0.1, etc.)

**Example: Gain Control**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
gain = hslider("gain",0,0,1,0.01);
process = *(gain);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `vslider` Primitive 

The `vslider` primitive implements a vertical slider.

**Usage**

* `min`: the minimum value of the slider
* `max`: the maximum value of the slider
* `step`: the precision (step) of the slider (1 to count 1 by 1, 0.1 to count
0.1 by 0.1, etc.)

**Example**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
gain = vslider("gain",0,0,1,0.01);
process = *(gain);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `nentry` Primitive 

The `nentry` primitive implements a "numerical entry".

**Usage**

```
nentry("label",init,min,max,step) : _
```

Where:

* `label`: the [label](#ui-labels-configuration) (expressed as a string) of the 
element in the interface
* `init`: the initial value of the numerical entry
* `min`: the minimum value of the numerical entry

to count 0.1 by 0.1, etc.)

**Example**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
gain = nentry("gain",0,0,1,0.01);
process = *(gain);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `hgroup` Primitive 

The `hgroup` primitive implements a horizontal group. A group contains other
UI elements that can also be groups. `hgroup` is not a signal processor per se
and is just a way to label/delimitate part of a Faust code.

**Usage**

```
hgroup("label",x)
```

Where:

* `label`: the [label](#ui-labels-configuration) (expressed as a string) of the 
element in the interface
* `x`: the encapsulated/labeled Faust code

**Example**

In the following example, the 2 UI elements controlling an oscillator are
encapsulated in a group.

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = vslider("freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
gain = vslider("gain",0,0,1,0.01);
process = hgroup("Oscillator",os.sawtooth(freq)*gain);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that the `Oscillator` group can be placed in a function in case we'd
like to add elements to it multiple times. 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
oscGroup(x) = hgroup("Oscillator",x);
freq = oscGroup(vslider("freq",440,50,1000,0.1));
gain = oscGroup(vslider("gain",0,0,1,0.01));
process = os.sawtooth(freq)*gain;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `vgroup` Primitive 

The `vgroup` primitive implements a vertical group. A group contains other
UI elements that can also be groups. `vgroup` is not a signal processor per se
and is just a way to label/delimitate part of a Faust code.

**Usage**

```
vgroup("label",x)
```

Where:

* `label`: the [label](#ui-labels-configuration) (expressed as a string) of the 
element in the interface
* `x`: the encapsulated/labeled Faust code

**Example**

In the following example, the 2 UI elements controlling an oscillator are
encapsulated in a group.

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
gain = hslider("gain",0,0,1,0.01);
process = vgroup("Oscillator",os.sawtooth(freq)*gain);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that the `Oscillator` group can be placed in a function in case we'd
like to add elements to it multiple times. 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
oscGroup(x) = vgroup("Oscillator",x);
freq = oscGroup(hslider("freq",440,50,1000,0.1));
gain = oscGroup(hslider("gain",0,0,1,0.01));
process = os.sawtooth(freq)*gain;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `tgroup` Primitive 

The `tgroup` primitive implements a "tab group." Tab groups can be used to
group UI elements in tabs in the interface. A group contains other
UI elements that can also be groups. `tgroup` is not a signal processor per se
and is just a way to label/delimitate part of a Faust code.

**Usage**

```
tgroup("label",x)
```

Where:

* `label`: the [label](#ui-labels-configuration) (expressed as a string) of the 
element in the interface
* `x`: the encapsulated/labeled Faust code

**Example**

In the following example, the 2 UI elements controlling an oscillator are
encapsulated in a group.

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
gain = hslider("gain",0,0,1,0.01);
process = tgroup("Oscillator",os.sawtooth(freq)*gain);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that the `Oscillator` group can be placed in a function in case we'd
like to add elements to it multiple times. 

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
oscGroup(x) = tgroup("Oscillator",x);
freq = oscGroup(hslider("freq",440,50,1000,0.1));
gain = oscGroup(hslider("gain",0,0,1,0.01));
process = os.sawtooth(freq)*gain;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `vbargraph` Primitive

The `vbargraph` primitive implements a vertical bar-graph (typically a meter
displaying the level of a signal).

**Usage**

`vbargraph` takes an input signal and outputs it while making it available to
the UI.

```
_ : vbargraph("label",min,max) : _
``` 

Where:

* `min`: the minimum value of the signal in the interface
* `max`: the maximum value of the signal in the interface

**Example: Simple VU Meter** 

A simple VU meter can be implemented using the `vbargraph` primitive:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = _ <: attach(_,abs : ba.linear2db : vbargraph("Level",-60,0));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note the use of the [`attach`](#attach-primitive) primitive here that forces 
the compilation of the `vbargraph` without using its output signal (see section 
on the [`attach` primitive](#attach-primitive)).

#### `hbargraph` Primitive

The `hbargraph` primitive implements a horizontal bar-graph (typically a meter
displaying the level of a signal).

**Usage**

`hbargraph` takes an input signal and outputs it while making it available to
the UI.

```
_ : hbargraph("label",min,max) : _
``` 

Where:

* `min`: the minimum value of the signal in the interface
* `max`: the maximum value of the signal in the interface

**Example: Simple VU Meter** 

A simple VU meter can be implemented using the `hbargraph` primitive:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = _ <: attach(_,abs : ba.linear2db : hbargraph("Level",-60,0));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note the use of the [`attach`](#attach-primitive) primitive here that forces 
the compilation of the `hbargraph` without using its output signal (see 
section on the [`attach` primitive](#attach-primitive)).

#### `attach` Primitive

The `attach` primitive takes two input signals and produces one output signal 
which is a copy of the first input. The role of `attach` is to force its second 
input signal to be compiled with the first one. From a mathematical standpoint 
`attach(x,y)` is equivalent to `1*x+0*y`, which is in turn equivalent to 
`x`, but it tells the compiler not to optimize-out `y`.

To illustrate this role, let's say that we want to develop a mixer application 
with a vumeter for each input signals. Such vumeters can be easily coded in 
Faust using an envelope detector connected to a bargraph. The problem is that 
the signal of the envelope generators has no role in the output signals. Using 
`attach(x,vumeter(x))` one can tell the compiler that when `x` is compiled 
`vumeter(x)` should also be compiled. 

The examples in the [`hbargraph` Primitive](#hbargraph-primitive) and the
[`vbargraph` Primitive](#vbargraph-primitive) illustrate well the use of
`attach`.

#### Variable Parts of a Label

Labels can contain variable parts. These are indicated with the sign `%` 
followed by the name of a variable. During compilation each label is processed 
in order to replace the variable parts by the value of the variable. 
For example:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = par(i,8,hslider("Voice %i", 0.9, 0, 1, 0.01));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

creates 8 sliders in parallel with different names while 
`par(i,8,hslider("Voice", 0.9, 0, 1, 0.01))` would have created only one 
slider and duplicated its output 8 times.

The variable part can have an optional format digit. For example `"Voice %2i"` 
would indicate to use two digit when inserting the value of `i` in the string.

An escape mechanism is provided. If the sign `%` is followed by itself, it will 
be included in the resulting string. For example `"feedback (%%)"` will result 
in `"feedback (%)"`.

#### Labels as Pathnames

Thanks to [horizontal](#hgroup-primitive), [vertical](#vgroup-primitive), and 
[tabs](#tgroup-primitive) groups, user interfaces have a hierarchical structure 
analog to a hierarchical file system. Each widget has an associated *path name* 
obtained by concatenating the labels of all its surrounding groups with its own 
label.

In the following example :

```
hgroup("Foo",
	...
	vgroup("Faa", 
		...
		hslider("volume",...)
		...
	)
	...
)
```

the volume slider has pathname `/h:Foo/v:Faa/volume`.

In order to give more flexibility to the design of user interfaces, it is 
possible to explicitly specify the absolute or relative pathname of a widget 
directly in its label. 

Elements of a path are separated using `/`. Group types are defined with the
following identifiers:

| Group Type | Group Identifier  |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| `hgroup`   | `h:`              |
| `vgroup`   | `v:`              |
| `tgroup`   | `t:`              |

Hence, the example presented in the 
[section on the `hgroup` primitive](#hgroup-primitive) can be rewritten as:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = vslider("h:Oscillator/freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
gain = vslider("h:Oscillator/gain",0,0,1,0.01);
process = os.sawtooth(freq)*gain;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

which will be reflected in C++ as:

```
virtual void buildUserInterface(UI* ui_interface) {
  ui_interface->openHorizontalBox("Oscillator");
  ui_interface->addVerticalSlider("freq", &fVslider1, 440.0f, 50.0f, 1000.0f, 0.100000001f);
  ui_interface->addVerticalSlider("gain", &fVslider0, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.00999999978f);
  ui_interface->closeBox();
}
```

Note that path names are inherent to the use of tools gravitating around Faust
such as [OSC control](TODO) or [`faust2api`](TODO). In the case of `faust2api`,
since no user interface is actually generated, UI elements just become a 
way to declare parameters of a Faust object. Therefore, there's no
distinction between `nentry`, `hslider`, `vslider`, etc.

#### Smoothing

Despite the fact that the signal generated by user interface elements can be
used in Faust with any other signals, UI elements run at a slower rate than 
the audio rate. This might be a source of clicking if the value of the 
corresponding parameter is modified while the program is running. This 
behavior is also amplified by the low resolution of signals generated by UI
elements (as opposed to actual audio signals). For example, changing the
value of the `freq` or `gain` parameters of the following code will likely 
create clicks (in the case of `gain`) or abrupt jumps (in the case of `freq`) 
in the signal:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
gain = hslider("gain",0,0,1,0.01);
process = os.osc(freq)*gain;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

This problem can be easily solved in Faust by using the [`si.smoo`](TODO) 
function which implements an exponential smoothing by a unit-dc-gain one-pole 
lowpass with a pole at 0.999 (`si.smoo` is just sugar for `si.smooth(0.999)`). 
Therefore, the previous example can be rewritten as:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,1000,0.1) : si.smoo;
gain = hslider("gain",0,0,1,0.01) : si.smoo;
process = os.osc(freq)*gain;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Beware that each `si.smoo` that you place in your code will add some extra
computation so they should be used precociously.  

#### Links to Generated Code

UI elements provide a convenient entry point to the DSP process in the 
code generated by the Faust compiler (e.g., C++, etc.). For example,
the Faust program:

```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
process = os.osc(freq);
```

will have the corresponding `buildUserInterface` method in C++:

```
virtual void buildUserInterface(UI* ui_interface) {
  ui_interface->openVerticalBox("osc");
  ui_interface->addHorizontalSlider("freq", &fHslider0, 440.0f, 50.0f, 1000.0f, 0.100000001f);
  ui_interface->closeBox();
}
```

The second argument of the `addHorizontalSlider` method is a pointer to the 
variable containing the current value of the `freq` parameter. The value of
this pointer can be updated at any point to change the frequency of the
corresponding oscillator.

### UI Label Metadata

[Widget labels](#user-interface-primitives-and-configuration) can contain 
metadata enclosed in square brackets. These metadata associate a key with a 
value and are used to provide additional information to the architecture file. 
They are typically used to improve the look and feel of the user interface, 
configure OSC and accelerometer control/mapping, etc. Since the format of the
value associated to a key is relatively open, metadata constitute a flexible
way for programmers to add features to the language.

The Faust code:

```
process = *(hslider("foo[key1: val 1][key2: val 2]",0,0,1,0.1));
```

will produce the corresponding C++ code:

```
class mydsp : public dsp {
  ...
  virtual void buildUserInterface(UI* ui_interface) {
    ui_interface->openVerticalBox("tst");
    ui_interface->declare(&fHslider0, "key1", "val 1");
    ui_interface->declare(&fHslider0, "key2", "val 2");
    ui_interface->addHorizontalSlider("foo", &fHslider0, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.100000001f);
    ui_interface->closeBox();
  }
  ...
};
```

All metadata are removed from the label by the compiler and transformed in 
calls to the `UI::declare()` method. All these `UI::declare()` calls will 
always take place before the `UI::AddSomething()` call that creates the 
User Interface element. This allows the `UI::AddSomething()` method to make 
full use of the available metadata.

Metadata are architecture-specific: it is up to the architecture file to decide
what to do with it. While some metadata will work with most architectures
(e.g., accelerometer and OSC configuration, etc.), others might be more 
specific. Some of them are presented in the following sections.

#### Ordering UI Elements

The order of UI declarations in a Faust code doesn't necessarily reflect the
actual order of the UI elements in the corresponding interface. Therefore,
UI elements can be ordered by placing a metadata before the declaration of
the name of the UI element in the label. For example, in the following 
declaration:

```
gain = vslider("h:Oscillator/[1]gain",0,0,1,0.01);
freq = vslider("h:Oscillator/[0]freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
```

the `freq` parameter will be placed before `gain` despite the fact that `gain`
is declared first.

This system can be used to order groups as well. Ordering will be carried out
on elements at the same level. For example:  

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freqS = vslider("h:Oscillators/h:[0]Sawtooth/[0]freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
gainS = vslider("h:Oscillators/h:[0]Sawtooth/[1]gain",0,0,1,0.01);
freqT = vslider("h:Oscillators/h:[1]Triangle/[0]freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
gainT = vslider("h:Oscillators/h:[1]Triangle/[1]gain",0,0,1,0.01);
process = os.sawtooth(freqS)*gainS + os.triangle(freqT)*gainT;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Note that this could also be written as:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freqS = vslider("[0]freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
gainS = vslider("[1]gain",0,0,1,0.01);
freqT = vslider("[0]freq",440,50,1000,0.1);
gainT = vslider("[1]gain",0,0,1,0.01);
process = hgroup("Oscillators",
  hgroup("[0]Sawtooth",os.sawtooth(freqS)*gainS) + 
  hgroup("[1]Triangle",os.triangle(freqT)*gainT)
);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### Global UI Metadata

Note that global user interfaces completely replacing the one defined using
the standard Faust UI primitives may be declared using 
[global metadata](#global-metadata). This is the case of the
[SmartKeyboard](TODO) interface for example. 

<!-- TODO Link to metadata declaration section -->

In the following subsections, the standard Faust UI metadata are documented.
Other types of metadata (e.g., accelerometers, OSC, etc.) are documented in the
sections related to these topics.

#### `[style:knob]` Metadata

The `[style:knob]` metadata turns any continuous UI element (i.e., 
[`hslider`](#hslider-metadata), [`vslider`](#vslider-metadata), 
[`nentry`](#nentry-metadata)) into a knob.

**Example**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = vslider("freq[style:knob]",440,50,1000,0.1);
process = os.sawtooth(freq);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `[style:menu]` Metadata

The `[style:menu]` metadata turns any continuous UI element (i.e., 
[`hslider`](#hslider-metadata), [`vslider`](#vslider-metadata), 
[`nentry`](#nentry-metadata)) into a drop-down menu.

**Usage**

```
[style:menu{'Name0':value0;'Name1':value1}]
```

Where:

* `NameN`: the name associated to `valueN`
* `valueN`: the value associated to `NameN`

**Example: Selector**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
s = vslider("Signal[style:menu{'Noise':0;'Sawtooth':1}]",0,0,1,1);
process = select2(s,no.noise,os.sawtooth(440));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `[style:radio]` Metadata

The `[style:radio]` metadata turns a [`hslider`](#hslider-metadata) or a 
[`vslider`](#vslider-metadata) into a radio-button-menu. The orientation of the
menu is determined by the type of UI element (i.e., `hslider` for horizontal
and `vslider` for vertical).

**Usage**

```
[style:radio{'Name0':value0;'Name1':value1}]
```

Where:

* `NameN`: the name associated to `valueN`
* `valueN`: the value associated to `NameN`

**Example: Selector**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
s = vslider("Signal[style:radio{'Noise':0;'Sawtooth':1}]",0,0,1,1);
process = select2(s,no.noise,os.sawtooth(440));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `[style:led]` Metadata

The `[style:led]` metadata turns a [`vbargraph`](#vbargraph-metadata) or a 
[`hbargraph`](#hbargraph-metadata) into a blinking LED (with varying 
intensity).

**Example: Level Display**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = _ <: attach(_,abs : ba.linear2db : vbargraph("Level[style:led]",-60,0));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `[unit:dB]` Metadata

The `[style:dB]` metadata changes the unit of a 
[`vbargraph`](#vbargraph-metadata) or a [`hbargraph`](#hbargraph-metadata) to 
dB. This impacts its overall appearance by applying a rainbow color scheme, etc.

**Example: Level Display**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = _ <: attach(_,abs : ba.linear2db : vbargraph("Level[style:dB]",-60,0));
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `[unit:xx]` Metadata

The `[unit:xx]` metadata allows us to specify the unit of a UI element. The
unit will be displayed right next to the current value of the parameter in
the interface. 

**Usage**

```
[unit:xx]
```

Where:

* `xx`: the unit of the current parameter

**Example**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = vslider("freq[unit:Hz]",440,50,1000,0.1);
process = os.sawtooth(freq);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `[scale:xx]` Metadata

The `[scale:xx]` metadata allows for the specification of a scale (different
than the default linear one) to the parameter in the UI. `[scale:log]` can be
used to change to scale to logarithmic and `[scale:exp]` to exponential.

#### `[tooltip:xx]` Metadata

The `[tooltip:xx]` metadata allows for the specification of a "tooltip" when  
the mouse hover a parameter in the interface. This is very convenient when
implementing complex interfaces.   

**Usage**

```
[tooltip:xx]
```

Where:

* `xx`: a string to be used as a tooltip in the interface

**Example**

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = vslider("freq[tooltip:The frequency of the oscillator]",440,50,1000,0.1);
process = os.sawtooth(freq);
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

#### `[hidden:xx]` Metadata

The `[hidden:xx]` metadata can be used to hide a parameter in the interface. 
This is convenient when controlling a parameter with a [motion sensor](TODO) 
or [OSC messages](TODO) and we don't want it to be visible in the interface. 
This feature is commonly used when making apps for Android and iOS using 
[`faust2android`](TODO) or [`faust2ios`](TODO).

**Compatibility**

* iOS 
* Android
