# FAUST - a programming language for audio applications and plugins
## Grame, Centre National de Creation Musicale : http://www.grame.fr


### Introduction

FAUST (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming
language specifically designed for real-time signal processing and
synthesis. A distinctive characteristic of FAUST is to be fully
compiled. 

The FAUST compiler translates DSP specifications into
very efficient C++ code that works at sample level. It targets
high-performance signal processing applications, libraries and
audio plug-ins for a variety of audio platforms and standards. A
same FAUST specification can be used to easily generate native
JACK or ALSA applications, as well as CSOUND, LADSPA, MAX/MSP, PD,
Q, SC and VST plugins. 


### Organization of the distribution

The Faust distribution can be downloaded at: [Faust Github Repo](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust)

It's organization is the following :

	architecture/          : the architecture files and libraries currently supported
	benchmark/             : tools to measure the impact of various compiler options
	compiler/              : sources of the Faust compiler
	documentation/         : Faust developer's documentation
	debian/                : files for Debian installation
	examples/              : examples of Faust programs with makefiles for various audio targets
	installer/             : various instalers for Linux distribution
	libraries/             : DSP libraries
	syntax-highlighting/   : support for syntax highlighting for several editors
	test/                  : various tests
	tools/                 : additional easy-to-use scripts to produce binaries and plugins
	windows/               : Windows projects


### Compilation and installation

#### To compile and install the Faust compiler on Linux and MacOSX : 

	make
	su
	make install

or

	sudo make install

It could be also useful to install additional tools, for example :

	cd tools/faust2appls/
	sudo make install

	
#### On Windows :

The first option is to use the Visual Studio 2008 solution
`/faust/compiler/windows/faust_vs2008.sln`. Open the solution with
the Visual Studio 2008 environment and run Build. Both
Debug/Release targets are supported.

The second solution is to download and install the QT4.6 SDK : 
	[QT4.6 SDK](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-windows-cpp)
and use the project file 'compiler.pro' in the compiler folder.


#### Compilation of the examples

Several FAUST examples are provided in the example folder. To
compile and test the examples with Jack/GTK do :

	cd examples
	make jackgtk

This will create a subfolder jackgtkdir with all the jack
applications. You can also create alsa applications (make alsagtk)
as well as other formats.

In order to compile your own applications, you can simply place you
files in the example folder and use the existing makefiles.

To list for possible audio targets :

	make help


About 20 different audio platforms are supported : 

- Action Script
- Alsa
- ChucK
- CoreAudio
- CSOUND
- iPhone
- Jack
- LADSPA
- Matlab
- MaxMSP
- Octave
- OSS
- PortAudio
- Pure
- PureData
- Q
- Sndfile
- Snd-RT
- SuperCollider
- SynthFile
- VST
- VSTi (mono)

For all these audio platforms you may have to install the related
SDK and/or development libraries.
