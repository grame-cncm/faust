//##################################### physmodels.lib ###################################
// Faust physical modeling library; Its official prefix is `pm`.
//
// This library provides an environment to facilitate physical modeling of musical
// instruments. It contains dozens of functions implementing low and high level
// elements going from a simple waveguide to fully operational models with
// built-in UI, etc.
//
// It is organized as follows:
//
// * [Global Variables](#global-variables): Useful pre-defined variables for
// physical modeling (e.g., speed of sound, etc.).
// * [Conversion Tools](#conversion-tools-1): Conversion functions specific
// to physical modeling (e.g., length to frequency, etc.).
// * [Bidirectional Utilities](#bidirectional-utilities): Functions to create
// bidirectional block diagrams for physical modeling.
// * [Basic Elements](#basic-elements-1): waveguides, specific types of filters, etc.
// * [String Instruments](#string-instruments): various types of strings
// (e.g., steel, nylon, etc.), bridges, guitars, etc.
// * [Bowed String Instruments](#bowed-string-instruments): parts and models
// specific to bowed string instruments (e.g., bows, bridges, violins, etc.).
// * [Wind Instrument](#wind-instruments): parts and models specific to wind
// string instruments (e.g., reeds, mouthpieces, flutes, clarinets, etc.).
// * [Exciters](#exciters): pluck generators, "blowers", etc.
// * [Modal Percussions](#modal-percussions): percussion instruments based on
// modal models.
// * [Vocal Synthesis](#vocal-synthesis): functions for various vocal synthesis
// techniques (e.g., fof, source/filter, etc.) and vocal synthesizers.
// * [Misc Functions](#misc-functions): any other functions that don't fit in
// the previous category (e.g., nonlinear filters, etc.)
//
// This library is part of the Faust Physical Modeling ToolKit.
// More information on how to use this library can be found on this page:
// <https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/pmFaust>. Tutorials on how to make
// physical models of musical instruments using Faust can be found
// [here](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/faustTutorials/#making-physical-models-of-musical-instruments-with-faust) as well.

/*
TODO:
	- It'd be cool to have a version of the block diagram generator that automatically flips
	things based on the use of chains, etc.
	- When setting pole of filters by hand (e.g. smooth, should adjust pole in function of SR)
	- Probably need a single resonator function / see how to integrate that with "mode"
	- Need a non-linear function and see how this can be integrated with modal synthesis
	- See how bowed modal models could be integarted to this
	- Currently still missing keyboard instruments
	- Currently still missing vocal synth: easy to fix (create a formant filter function)
	- Real polyphonic instruments should be designated with some kind of prefix (e.g.,
	full)

// input/output is used to carry any potential output signal to the end of the
// algorithm.
//========================================================================================

// input/output is used to carry any potential output signal to the end of the
// algorithm. The implied one sample delay created by the `~` operator is

//-------`terminations`--------------
// Creates terminations on both sides of a [`chain`](#chain) without closing
// the inputs and outputs of the bidirectional signals chain. As for
