# How to compile

By default, you can simply type `make` in the `build` folder to compile the **Faust** compiler and the **OSC and HTTP** libraries.
On output, you'll find applications in the `build/bin` folder and libraries in the `build/lib` folder.

Type `make help` for details on targets and options.
