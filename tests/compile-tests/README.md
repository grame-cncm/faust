# Compile tests

### Prerequisites
- `faust` must be available from the command line or from the `build/bin` folder. It must be compiled with all backends but the `interp` backend.

### What's being done
All examples found is the `examples` and `regression` folders are compiled using all the available backends (apart the `interp` backend). In addition and for the c, cpp and ocpp backends, the output is also compiled using the available compilers.


Type `make help` for details on the available targets.


### Files excluded from tests

- `faust-stk` : the 'c' backend doesn't compile due to C++ specific implementation of foreign functions.
- `TODO` : files names containing TODO
